    "transcript": " [Music] yesterday we spent 2 and 1 half hours watching the inauguration all of us were there with baited breath and all he wanted him to do was just mention something about crypto something about the Strategic reserve and guess what Trump didn't mention anything about crypto panic in the market right now and everyone's calling for the end of the bull market and whether Trump is going to stick to his election promises and everyone is starting to panic and what I don't like about this Market I don't like the fact that what Trump is doing is he's practically controlling the markets whether it's through the mem coin that he's launching or whether the purchases that world Liberty fire making every move that Trump makes is pretty much now being uh uh watched by the market and so what we're going to do today is we're actually going to look at what Trump is buying and hint it's a lot of eth and whether he's actually making the right move and whether there are tokens that you can buy that actually beat him that's what you're going to be doing today so if you like that idea obliterate the but also we're going to look at to see what Trump is going to do and how long he's got because I reckon if Trump doesn't do something in the next 48 hours around crypto then I think that this Market could actually dump that's what we're going to be talking about today if you like that idea obliterate the like button let's go we're looking at Bitcoin at 105,000 and as I said I think if Trump doesn't do something in the next 24 to 48 hours then I think this Market could actually done because we sat here and we waited for Trump to do something in the inauguration yesterday I don't know about you I was going to go to hot yoga yesterday right and instead of going to Hot Yoga yesterday I postponed it because of the inauguration because I thought something would happen and I sat there and I was watching and I was watching and I was watching just like you guys were and guess what nothing happened very nothing happened pretty much we sat here just watching the inauguration and so now the Market's like going to panic right because what they're asking is is Trump actually going to fulfill his promises to crypto and you can see that the the odds of the Strategic Reserve have now gone down truth is if Trump doesn't do something crypto related in the next 48 hours how is this Market actually going to hold because it's not like he did nothing yesterday right he did like he did a whole lot of things he signed a whole lot of executive orders I don't know if you guys watched he signed 42 executive orders he implemented 115 Personnel actions more than 200 executive actions 60 Minutes of press q&as three speeches and nothing about crypto and remember that the market had huge expectations because we were kind of there were leaks leaks in inverted commers where we thought that Trump was going to sign to to uh to implement the uh um uh um to to implement a strategic Reserve or to pass the executive order and we got nothing but he did say set up the official Doge he he did sign the executive order here he is he signed the executive order which gave rise to the Department of government efficien governmental efficiency known as okay that's a big one is Elon Musk to get a West office no um he's getting an office for about 20 people that were hiring to make sure that these get implemented we have a problem in this country you sign an executive order doesn't get done for sale 6 months as an example when we allowed the j6 hostages to go out uh it might not be approved in under the old days by for two weeks 3 weeks 6 months you know they had a good ruling from the Supreme Court and so they started the department of government efficiency now there's a department of government efficiency website and that's why the Doge token but not the Doge like the big Doge the other Doge token actually had had a bit of a run speaking of a department of government efficiency I don't know if you saw this but VI ramaswami who was supposed to be with Elon in the department of government efficiencies looks like he Ste down now I've read a lot of the Articles and doesn't sound like he it sounded like there must have been some kind of disagreement either between him and Trump or between him and Elon either way something went wrong here because he basically the excuse that he used is that he's going to become the government or he intends to to run for the government of Ohio the governor of Ohio and so that is the excuse that he used as to why he stepped down from uh the department of government efficiency anyway so Trump did a whole lot of things he declared a state of emergency at the border I do think that that's may be more important than crypto to him he designated cartels as foreign terrorist organizations I do think that that's more important than crypto military will be directed to construct a new phase of the border wall That's All Around immigration probably more important than crypto National Energy emergency probably more important than crypto terminate Biden executive orders on drilling restrictions more important than crypto return federal workers in to in work in to iners work more important than crypto pours all offshore wind leases I don't know what that is and Dei hiring practices in the federal government I think that is more important than than crypto order every agency to remove all federal a federal actions increasing costs for Americans via deregulation that is more important than crypto establish a doge hiring freeze that is more important than crypto and leave the World Health Organization that is more important than crypto so I I agree that most of the things that Trump actually signed yesterday as a president of the country to me would be more important than signing the Bitcoin strategic Reserve but I don't think that's the reason why Trump didn't uh didn't sign the the Strategic Reserve yesterday and now we get crypto like in a panic so people are going this is a huge year for crypto Pro government crypto for the first time biggest onchain onboarding event we've ever seen Bitcoin treasury being established more companies purchasing Bitcoin more ETFs on the way day one in in the office Trump Trump trump didn't sign the executive order for the crypto Bros top is in everyone's out to losers so some people are giving up other people have another thing they are kicking the can down the road I call this the the frog in the boiling water why because initially you say okay if Trump comes into office on the first day and he doesn't he doesn't sign the the Bitcoin strategic reserve and he doesn't free Ross Al on the first day then it's over for the Crypt Bros one day later Trump walks into office nothing happened look we got confirmation that it's we're amongst the first 200 executive orders and you know uh Russ Al is going to be renewed it's just going to take a little more time those are the two camps right now some people given up saying the top is in some people saying look you know he's got more important things that actually happened um willly woo says the Bitcoin strategic reserves need needs buying from Congress and the house issuing an executive order on the inauguration day is a blunt way to execute this the smart way is to assess the likel of success before pushing the go button so people are now starting to justify why it did happen or didn't happen that's pretty much where the market is now right I think I have another another uh um uh view as to as to what actually happened and why it didn't happen I want to explain that view to you but before I do I need you to subscribe to the channel cuz I know a lot of you unsubscribed I know you are not subscribed what you need to do is subscribe to the channel can you go get my little um yeah so I know I know you're not subscribed also if you are here I see 475 likes usually by this stage of the St there's like 1,500 likes let's go let's obliterate the like button so we can carry on I'll explain to you now why I think that Trump didn't sign the Bitcoin executive order and I'm going to give you two points of view the first point of view that I want to give you is a very simple reality check signing a Bitcoin strategic Reserve is not important for the United States and it certainly isn't important for the United States when you compare it to all the things that I spoke about now I know to us it's the most important thing but if I was a president and I was coming to rule a country with the with the amount of problems that the United States has because of the Joe Biden and Cara Harris administration every single one of these things would be more important to to me than your silly Bitcoin Reserve right it's not a matter of national importance I know that to us it is but to Trump it's not okay let's just be honest okay if you went to your mom or I don't know someone who's not in crypto and you said hey Granny hey Mom these are the things that Trump did and he didn't put a a Bitcoin strategic where would you put a Bitcoin strategic Reserve here they would like sorry what's the Strategic reserve and why do we need it right so that's the first reason but I do think there might might be a second reason why even if Trump was going to do it why he didn't do it yesterday and I think that the reason is this over here when you look at the Trump token and you look at the Melania token I think that these two tokens were the reason why Trump never spoke about crypto in his speech I think that they launched the tokens they expected tokens to have a five or six billion doll market cap or maybe a 1010 billion do market cap then this thing goes to $70 billion market cap and Melania goes to $5 billion market cap and together they've got a a market cap of $8 billion and I think someone in the Trump family said just be careful cuz these things are much bigger than we thought in fact in the crypto World $70 billion and another $10 billion from Melania is actually seismic if something happens it's seismic also the truth is You' you launched this token you caught the whole world by surprise like you caught the whole world by surprise including yourself and the worst thing that you can now do is get on the stage and actually pump crypto when everybody knows that 80% of the tokens around Trump are in your hands and 80% of the tokens around Melania are not in your hands and so I think it actually would have been a political risk for Trump to actually get up there and after the launch of of uh Trump and Melania actually talk about crypto in the inauguration day I think that remember one thing about Americans Americans love to try and impeach presidents they love it like it's like a thing they like like um actually Trump's actually been impeached or they tried to impeach him a few times first time second time Americans love to impeach president it's how they show that the system is fair they showed that the system is fair by showing that you know we even take on our own president and we try and fire our own president right that's what Americans do and so I think Trump has to be very very very very careful right I think he I think after launch of trump coin and Melania coin because of the links that they had I think if he would have got up in the inauguration speech the biggest speech that the government has given in someone just sent me something about the SEC maybe it's got something to do with Trump let's have a look here 5 billion a applied for Trump ETF today what are you talking about okay we'll we'll get we'll get it looks like it looks like uh it looks like someone applied for Trump ETF anyway let's continue so as I was saying you can't go you can't go in the biggest speech in the world right you can't go in the biggest speech in the world after you've just launched a mcoin where you and your cronies own 80% of the mcoin and then you go and add crypto to the speech and pump up the mem coin even more and so I think that Trump has to be accountable like you know in the USA the one thing that you can say is no one no one no one is above the law except hter Biden okay but other than that no one no one no one is above the law in the United States and you can challenge a president and I think that the biggest [\u00a0__\u00a0] up that we had so you can't say [\u00a0__\u00a0] up on YouTube okay the biggest mess up that we had is that we had Trump and Melania launch on the weekend and so I think that a probably Bitcoin is not as much of a priority to Trump as it is for us and B I think that the launch of trump and milania tokens actually did us uh did us a whole lot of of of damage so now we are in a position where we all feel neglected right I don't as I said like I missed hot yoga for for for for um for Trump and I mean for those of you who don't know what hot yoga is it's basically like you go into a yoga studio and they blow like this hot air like a sauna into the hot yoga studio and then basically you and a bunch of people it's quite a quite a weird mix of people right um generally like it's I'll tell you like the kind of people that you get in this hot yoga studio so you get like you get the absolute belters then you get like the okay the okay ones then you get like these like gay guys that are wearing like leopard tights and they take their shirt off in the hot yoga and they sweat you know if you've been to Hot Yoga you know I'll take you today to Hot Yoga and you'll see do you want to come with me to Hot Yoga today do you have le petites no I have normal shorts normal shorts won't work bro you got to pick your you got to pick your your thing anyway so I missed hot yoga for this and Trump didn't even um uh someone people that don't even know what hot yoga is um okay so as I was saying um now we need Trump to do something and the next thing that we need Trump to do since it's now clear that he's not going to sign an executive order around a strategic Reserve or maybe he will in fact there is a good chance that he will we need him to free Ross or now the truth is that that Trump actually did free a lot of people yesterday he freed all the J 6 uh people and um um I said I tweeted just I said it's so important that Trump actually pardons Ross Alber now and there's a good chance that he will because Elon said Ross will be free too when they were speaking about um uh when they were speaking about uh what he did uh Elon actually TW tweeted on thing he said Ross will also be freed so I think that Elon probably knows a little bit more uh than we know right now and um yeah so I think that good thing for me the good thing for me is when I now look at the markets I look at the markets and I see that you know the Trump token is back at 40 billion still high but but and then you got melano at 4.2 billion thing is if you look at the market caps not the cuz I was looking at fully diluted but if you look at the market caps here the Trump market cap is $7 billion and the milania market cap is now at 616 I mean Melania is pretty much she's she's red 616 million she must be so upset with Trump bro she must be so upset upset with Trump anyway or Baron she's probably upset with Baron anyway so what I'm what I'm happy about is that the market is back to not normality but at least there's not so much of the liquidity that is not trapped in trumpcoin and Melania coin and I really really really hope that um I really really really hope that uh it stays like that because I don't want those token and sucking the liquidity out of the market at the moment specifically not at a time like this where the altcoins are absolutely wrecked I mean it's not only it's I mean when you look at the altcoin market Sonic after being up 11% is at 61 cents these altcoins are are like in the in the dumps except for hyper liquid um I mean I saw popcat this is the token that was at $2 is not 45 the memes have been absolutely absolutely destroyed by this thing if you look at the alt coins if if you look at the rsis the rsis have completely reset if you look at the 4H hour rsis for those of you who don't know this is like the momentum indicator the sentiment indicator and you can see that the rsis have pretty much I going to say bottom because there's always lower to go but they've definitely definitely definitely reset on the altcoins and on the 12h hour on the 4H hour on the 24hour actually see let's check the one week on the one week I'm assuming they're also quite low so the rsis have completely reset as you can see um and but but what I don't like right now is that Trump is completely completely completely in control of this Market when I say he completely in control of this Market whether it's through the meme coins sucking out the liquidity out of the alt coins or whether it's through whatever World Liberty fire is doing because it really it really feels like there's two things moving the markets now it's one thing it's Trump is he going to do a strategic Reserve is he not going to do a strategic Reserve is he going to what what is Liberty World Liberty fire going to buy and you can see that they've been buying eth they've been buying um uh Bitcoin they've been buying Ave they've been buying link they've been buying Athena and those are the only tokens that actually run so you're in a position now where Trump is in control of the market right but I think Trump's also been very smart in high played this the Strategic Reserve is on bitcoin World Liberty is deployed on eth but also really buying up a lot of eth related protocols a Athena Etc and the meme coins have been deployed on salana so now everybody is completely confused because Trump is in control of the market but but which chain what should what should you be buying and so we're getting a bit of a battle now between the eth people who are saying look Trump loves eth you can see he bought $47 Million worth of eth $47 Million worth of bitcoin $4.7 Million worth of I by the way I think I know what world Liberty f is doing I can't confirm this but I think I know what they're doing because I I don't know where they got so much money from they didn't raise this this amount of money I think they're doing token swaps with the big protocols mark my words that's going to come out that news is going to come out at some point because they didn't raise this this amount of money where are they getting 100 million to buy Bitcoin e where are they getting 4.7 million to buy a it'll come out one day very soon that these guys were swapping their tokens for tokens in the big protocols remember ran told you bookmark this bookmark this here anyway I think it's a great protocol by the way um so someone says I hold a big bag of soul I won't let myself fall in love with it it's being a great run but from this point on eth is poised to outperform believe it or not people believe that eth is poised to outperform I think I got a rogue here yeah it's just one Rogue here um then you've got this guy over here who says does ethereum in a circle know what that that eth is not a stable coin picked to $3,500 and then Mike Duda says I've abandoned eth despite supporting in the past yes ethereum has banned its users supporting them in the past the idea of sitting around jerking off watching the burn and concocting Pur tests while zero newcomers can afford the chain fees is growth is gross and then you know what I thought I just thought okay look now I need to understand I need to understand who is going to perform better eth or Soul because now I really thought because everyone told me and then I told you because everyone told me that like the seasonality is on east side you know q1 is the best performing quarter for eth always January is the best performing month for E eth usually performs 33.2 30% in January and so I thought i' I'd put this to to the test and so I went to Twitter and I asked two questions I said which one will perform better in q1 2025 and which one will perform better in the entire year 2025 the reason why I did q1 and entire year because I wanted to play on the seasonality because everyone's got this like thing in their heads that eth has seasonality in January right and in q1 and so I wanted to like debunk this myth and I want to show you exactly uh sain says he agrees with me today did you find the one guy who agrees with me in the whole chat there's like one guy in the whole chat that agrees with me and you've like you've left this comment on for like 40 minutes already cuz it's one one guy finally agrees with me finally agrees with me okay so so um I wanted to know what I wanted to to debunk this this thing and I actually wanted to get to the bottom of who is going to do better Soul or eth Trump is buying soul is buying eth but he's launched his his his coin on salana so which one is going to perform better in q1 and which one is going to perform better in the end of the in q1 in in this last quarter of 2025 right sorry in the year of 2025 which is the last year I think of the bull run so I went and did all the analysis right and the first part of my analysis was around this seasonality right and I said okay well you know the market says that eth always performs well in q1 q1 is the best performing quarter for eth you can see specifically in the post Haring year eth performed very very very well in uh in 2017 and very very very well in 2021 160% in quarter 1 and 526 in quarter 1 okay great but what if I replace the word ethia with the second blockchain the one which people are actually using and I didn't call it eth and I said instead of eth performs well in q120 in q1 then let's just say the the smart contract blockchain with the most users is the one that performs well in q1 and Q in q1 then we could just replace the word e with soul and that would make a lot more sense in the chart right because if I look at this move here in Soul from the b in eth from the bottom this was the eth bottom which was $88.6 cents it was during Co and then eth recovered 1,300% to this point in the cycle and then from this point in the cycle and I'm talking to you about 2021 eth went up another 246 per. but isn't that very similar to this chart over here where where salana bottoms here at $8 takes us to one January takes us takes us to here 2350 and then continues to climb up for the rest of the cycle doesn't this and this look very very very much like the same pattern right here has the first pattern over here here's the second pattern here has here has the same pattern over here let me just here let me here you got you got you got this pattern over here which looks very very very much like this pattern over here and then I was like hold on a second maybe what they mean is that eth is not the one that performs well in the first quarter but the smart contract blockchain which is the most supported and most used smart contract blockchain in q1 is actually the one that performs the best in the post Haring year and maybe people just said eth because in the past all they had was eth okay but that wasn't enough for me okay cuz that that wasn't enough for me I needed to get into the actual wheat and so what I did was I actually did a analysis again and I said look let me write all the eth catalysts and let me write all the salana Catalyst and let's look at the eth Catalyst and then let's look at the um the salana Catalyst and decide which one is going to perform the best in q1 and which one is going to perform the best for the rest of 2025 so let's start off with the eth Catalyst the first eth catalyst is Trump has eth World Liberty fire has eth right so Trump over here has e eth you can see he bought $47 Million worth of eth and Trump has eth and eth has an ETF which Soul doesn't have by the way so eth Catalyst well it has an ETF and Trump has eth when it comes to um when it comes to e uh to eth catalysts let me just format this I don't know there we go so when it comes to to an ETF there is an amendment which is going to happen to the eth ETF and the the amendment is around allowing staking yield in the eth ETFs in the beginning when we um when we launched the E ETFs they wanted to include staking yield but the SEC they realized that if they did they said the exclusion of staking of from these filings is necessary to meet the sec's regulatory requirements and so what they said is you can have an eth ETF but you can't have the yield the staking yield now it might not sound like a lot but here with eth you lose 3.85% and so when they put in the staking yield in the ETF You could argue that a lot more Wall Street managers are going to say okay I'm going to put more money into it because I'm actually also earning a yield right that's the next thing then eth has coinbase and coinbase has agents right so eth has base base is I don't know one of the most used chains out there and also the whole AI narrative is actually living on base and actually on Sal so you could say that eth has base base which Soul doesn't have Bas has agents eth also has a whole lot of new updates I don't know if these updates actually mean anything to be honest they're like a whole lot of updates to eventually in 2029 get get us to like a point where e can do like five transactions per second or something stupid like that okay uh eth is the institutional chain or it has been labeled the institutional chain if you look at like um what Black Rock says let's just see if we can get let's just go the iwa a XYZ you can see that eth is the biggest rwa chain and real world assets are pretty much where the institutions are playing right so black Rock's B 542 build fund is overwhelmingly on ethereum build build bule is on ethereum I highly doubt that ever changes um soet General is building on E UBS is building on eth MasterCard is building on E so you could say that the institutional liquidity is actually on eth if you look at the facts eth has 72 billion in tvl so in terms of liquidity on chain S has 13 billion and of the $29 billion of stable coins e has 53.8% dominance so if you're looking for liquidity and if you're looking for tvl then you really can't argue that that the researchers are saying well done research team should we get into this argue arent now so the question then really is with all of these catalysts can eth actually beat soul and I think what you need to ask yourself is you need to actually look deeper and you need to ask yourself the same questions out of Soul so we've gone through eth this week go through again eth has Trump eth has an ETF they're going to change the ETF to include staking and then stakers can earn a 3% yield eth has coinbase coinbase has agents there's a whole lot of new updates on eth eth has the highest liquidity eth also has the highest tvl and eth has the highest amount of stable coins let me just write that eth has most most stable coins okay so that's eth now let's look at what soul has because Soul Believe It or Not also has a few things actually going for it right first thing is well you can say that Trump owns eth but Trump launched uh Melania and you know like it's okay if you launch yourself right but if you launch your wife on the wrong chain bro there's no your wife will never forgive you for launching her on the wrong chain especially after the chart looks something like this right so so yes eth has Trump eth has uh Trump has eth but Trump launched on Melania and Melia launched on Soul David saxs who's the crypto are well he loves Soul okay he loves Soul he's not a big he's not a big eth fan in fact he was quoted on on um this video over here talking about how much David sex is Major investor in L and thinks it can surpass eth that was on on the Allin podcast and he's now the cryptos are then I think we can say after this weekend that eth sorry that soul is really the only battle tested chain there's no chain in crypto in the world that has done 10% of the nasdaq's daily volume in one day no one has done that no one's even come close not even eth not even with crypto kitties or not even with all their transactions ever ever ever came close to to uh to the number of transactions so if you want a chain that's going to do the most transactions and is going to be cheap well then salana is the one right now salana should actually even get an ETF there's a 90% chance that salana is going to get an ETF and whereas eth may get a slight change in its ETF to include staking the salana ETF is a brand new cataly which is going to bring in a whole lot of flows and chances are it'll also include staking yield and when it does you'll realize that the staking yield on salana is currently 7.14% and the staking yield on eth is 3.85% obviously that's going to change but what you can see right now is that uh if salana does get an ETF that is Major incremental news and it has doubled the yield and so I think that there'll be I I think I agree with the analysts which say that there is a more there's 4 to8 billion sorry there's $1 billion that can go into eth versus $3.6 billion that can go into uh into the salana ETF as a percentage analysts are forecasting that salana will have five times the relative inflow to market cap of eth into a thing now let's go to um let's go let's carry on with the salana Catalyst agents live on salana salana is the winning chain look this is the dominance in terms of agents in fact if you want to talk agents and infrastructure salana has got about double the agents that that base has got so you can say that that eth has Bas and Bas has agents but salana has double the amounts of Agents memes live on the salana network retail lives on the salana network if you look at what retail is look at moonshot which is the app that allows people to buy things on salana look at Phantom higher higher than coinbase because people were trading on chain and and so salana is so salana really is the retail chain salana also has amazing upgrades this year they've got fire dancer which is going to make the validators a lot more decentralized also going to increase the amount of transactions that they can do they will release fire on they'll fix congestion um they have several me systems and so they they do have a very very very strong and robust product Road mapap um soul is made in the USA and you have to take a bet that at some point what Trump is going to do is he's going to do something for chains that are made in the USA and soul is made in the USA whereas eth is not made in the USA eth is made I think in Canada or I don't know where it's where think the foundations in Zug blah blah blah blah blah okay uh institutions actually also love S I know that maybe right now when it comes to real world assets they're not winning but if you look at all the institutions um that support salana let me just try and find you something here I had a a tweet here which showed all the institutions that support salana So at breakpoint we had Franklin Templeton securitize which is partnered up with black rock we had soet General we had City Bank we had Visa we had PayPal we had all launching on salana so you can't say that eth is the institutional chain because as many institutions are launching on on on salana uh Soul has a higher staking ratio as you can see and it also has a higher yield 64% of all salana St and 7.14% at 7.1 4% yield and so now you look at both eth and soul and you've seen all the catalysts for both eth and soul and we got to make a call as to which token which ecosystem is going to do better and I think just to make it a whole lot easier for you ask yourself some questions which which decks is going to perform better from now until the end of the cycle Unis swap or radium which perpetual's infrastructure protocol is going to perform better is it going to be synthetics or is it going to be uh uh uh Drift from a lending point of view or from a from a staking point of view is it going to be Lio or is it going to be GTO from uh Paulo put in that cloud thing right after he told me to buy cloud and then he put it in here and then now look at it you see so who's going to perform better rocket pool or or Cloud which Oracle is going to perform better chain link or pith got to ask yourself these questions let me summarize it for you like this if you want to understand who is going to do better between now and the end of the year I think you have to ask yourself a question what is going to happen between now and the end of 2025 is there going to be more retail adoption or is is there going to be more institutional adoption my theory as it relates to this is very simple I think the institutions will definitely definitely definitely come but I think it takes them a lot longer to come than it takes for the retail investors to come we saw how quickly the retail investors came when we launch memec coins or when we launch trumpcoin now the institutions will take years and years and years to actually move so if you ask me who's going to perform better in the cycle I think there's no there's no question about it I think soul is going to kick eth's ass simple right specifically in the cycle what happens after the cycle well it just depends on what eth can build I'm obviously a much bigger salana fan I think salana is cheaper I think salana is faster I think the developers are hungrier I think they make decisions much much much quicker and so for me I'm putting my money and my bets on so do I have an eth bet I do have an eth bet because I like a diversified portfolio but my soul outnumbers my my my Solano outnumbers my eth by about 10 to1 okay that's pretty much the ratio of what I've got sold to e so I hope that's helped you I hope you enjoyed the alpha Before I Let You Go I do want to remind you of a few things number one I want to remind you that Kyle dupes is running a crypto school yeah I want you to just watch how amazing this crypto school is if you just Implement everything that you'll be able to succeed you should have all the tools at your disposal everything a lot of what I learned is from professional institutional investors and I put that in the course I think it's enough in there for you to literally go from not knowing anything or even being intermediate to being a professional Trader advaned but stay safe out there don't over leverage respect your money or it's going to find somewhere else to go it will find someone else to look after it don't get too caught up in the hype understand the psychological phases everything that I covered we
