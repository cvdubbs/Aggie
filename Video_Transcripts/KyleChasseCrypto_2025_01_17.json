    "transcript": " the Bitcoin ETF was the most successful ETF in history period that's it and that opportunity ladies and gentlemen is coming once again with a whole new wave of ETFs with a brand new Administration in the United States but not all cryptocurrencies in fact just a few of them actually stand a chance of getting an ETF approval we've got Bitcoin and ethereum and on Today's Show Ladies and Gentlemen I'm going to tell you what other cryptocurrencies are likely to get an ETF approval this year or potentially next you're not going to want to miss this one it's a big one ladies and gentlemen without further Ado let's get into it and do me a favor destroy the like button subscribe to the channel if you're not already what's up my name is Kyle sh I've been in this space for 13 years the whole point here is to bring you guys all the alpha so we can actually crush it together in this upcoming massive super cycle and look at the markets right now pumping like they should Bitcoin almost at $104,000 and you're going to find out exactly why we're going to talk about the ETFs we're going to talk about the macro environment we're going to talk about the good stuff no AI agents today ladies and gentlemen all right so we had big inflows yesterday 626 million on bitcoin this is just not slowing down guys even more interesting a large inflow on E yesterday as well 166 million on eth biggest day in a long time for the ethereum ETFs as well and guys as miles so eloquently put over here over the last 13 years 10 of them have been dominated by Bitcoin as the best performing asset class that year and this is really uh interesting too so Bitcoin bags are better than old school assets 52% of Americans are making the swap over half of Americans are trading in stocks and gold for Bitcoin with 68% now holding crypto gen Z is diving in Young starting at an average age of 22 while Millennials follow at 29 and 60% of holders are ready to Double Down by 2025 and I can tell you that there definitely was so my cousins my young cousins frany and B Emma Ava Eva wasn't there other ones uh so I just got a a message from Franny recently and she said she has bought her first crypto 50 bucks and guess which one it was I will tell you guys later in the video because we're going to talk about it but it gives you perspective of what's going on who when you have this new wave of retail coming into the market what are they going to be buying we're going to talk about that today if you are more risk adverse right and you don't want to come into all these new mean coins and crap and we're moving past a lot of that now right of course they still have their place but the markets are now going to be very very real it's happening it's uh the regulation is going to be Pro regulation crypto is going to be a thing that is no longer just something for you know ladies of the night and drugs and criminal Behavior but it's now completely normalized this was pretty cool so s Senator Cynthia Lumis lumus uh wrote a letter to the US Marshall service asking why they plan on selling 70,000 Bitcoin and when if you look into it she actually said over here hey ding-dongs US Marshals I I think that you guys aren't very smart because between 2014 and 2023 you sold 195,930 million which is now worth $18.9 billion today for a net loss of $18.5 billion dollar and now you're about to do it again stupid by selling the 6937 Bitcoin from Silk Road right we've talked about that before and and the response the US Marshall says the US government cannot continue denying the value of its Bitcoin it's costing taxpayers billions no you are losing the United States billions if you sell this Bitcoin oh well don't worry no sweat guys it's does it's not going to affect us either way DJ news over here says new Trump plans to designate cryptocurrency as a national priority per Bloomberg so executive order expected to create a crypto advisory Council Trump allies are discussing stopping Federal crypto litigation we know all of this right and Becker over here says Trump is literally bullish [\u00a0__\u00a0] posting at this point us crypto reserves no crypto tax buy Mass buying eth intent for 150,000 plus Bitcoin how are you not bullish let's go Fred Krueger over here says that he is pretty damn certain that on Monday yep Monday just a few days away that there will be the announcement of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve wow it's Monday already that's amazing wow last weekend of the old Administration starting next week guys we have a new one wow that's crazy okay well let's hope that everything goes well with the inauguration you know I've heard some crazy stuff about some crazy rumors you know tin foil hat stuff about drone attacks and dangered inauguration and who knows but I would wouldn't surprise me if there was another attempt let's hope there's not so Fred Krueger is is pretty damn sure that on day one there's going to be a Bitcoin strategic Reserve announced why because because there's a very large number of executive orders announced on Monday this is a given if there isn't an executive order on a Bitcoin strategic Reserve in this large number of announcements then Trump's donors will be very upset Trump does not want this at the start of his presidency therefore there will be a Bitcoin Strat Reserve executive order on Monday again speculation but yeah it's speculation Fred Krueger says he gu gues it you know we'll see we'll see but poly markets who correctly predicted the outcome of the election when the mainstream media was saying otherwise has the odds of a Bitcoin strategic Reserve at 65% in 2025 coin Telegraph says these are the eight states that are leading the charge to push a strategic Bitcoin Reserve Florida Alabama New Hampshire Pennsylvania Ohio North Dakota Oklahoma and teas now the nice thing about Bitcoin and deflationary assets are the the scarcity the artificial scarcity the fact that we cannot have any more now why is this interesting well this is interesting because like even if like so now that you have all these states and everything buying Bitcoin and proposing Bitcoin reserves it serves a state or an entity or a corporation or an individual ual best to acquire Bitcoin and then go shill it to your friends or another business or another government or another state and have them buy bags after you do because it'll make the price go up right and this is the nice thing about the way that Bitcoin works and crypto works so inevitably and this is why you know this is why it also is has a self-fulfilling prophecy you know that's why that's why why do you think Michael S alert is out there evangelizing Bitcoin every other day because his his bags depend on it right and as miles over here says we have a 7year low of Bitcoin on exchanges right now Supply shock coming for sure Supply shock is when you want to go buy Bitcoin and there's none to buy and so people only sell it to you for much higher and this is when the price goes skyrockets because everyone realized izes that there's no more Bitcoin for sale unless it's really really high right so just almost no Bitcoin left on exchanges and there's never been more demand in the world than there is today for Bitcoin and crypto Quant over here just shows that there's been increase of inflow of Bitcoin into uh coinbase Prime which is basically what institutions are using to buy Bitcoin we've known this right with the change of accounting rules it's much more likely that people take the Michael sailor people I mean corporations take the Michael sailor routes and start putting Bitcoin on their balance sheet right and that's likely what's happening with coinbase prime right now Becker's thesis over here and this is something that's I mean he just said it in a in a good way so everyone and their dog thinks that we're going to make the big final leg of the cycle toward 150k not me but uh I do do think a lot of people are saying that right uh and I think that's I I you know it it's funny too that like Alex is now bull posting Bitcoin of course like you know I mean his channel always talks about altcoins uh and I think he's you know me's right that like altcoins are going to have outperformed Bitcoin from here moving forward uh but anyway let me let me move on but anyway it's nice to see him talking about the Bitcoin and saying you know that it's going to definitely pump like crazy and and it's good because like normally this is boring it is boring like uh I guess if you're like looking at an ALT season its performance becomes boring but it's so so important to hold it so important to hold it right and he says call me crazy but I think we are calling this way too low and way too short 150k is only one six the market cap of gold we have the biggest funds Nations corporations all and I mean all of them recognizing as a sort of value aiming to collect it why on Earth would it stop at 1 16 market cap of a rock that's infinitely harder to hold manage access store and has an unknown cap right has an unknown Supply can still be mined it exists outside of Earth Bitcoin doesn't so essentially what he's saying over here is it doesn't make sense he said he said said if if we didn't have all of this happening okay 100 50 to 150k range makes sense but we do have all of this and so he thinks it's more likely that we go 250 to 400k these are fundamentals for those of you guys who like astrology for Crypt Bros technical analysis we have some ta over here saying that the total crypto market cap excluding Bitcoin is on the break of a golden cross you can see this is over here when this moving average crosses this moving average over here things pump according to TA and we're we're just getting here and this is alt season right so crypto total market cap excluding Bitcoin and eth this is talking about altcoins so altcoins are on the brink of alt season and this is when all of our bags are going to pump so so nicely and this is what we've been waiting for preparing for packing our bags for it's coming ladies and gentlemen it's coming it's coming it's just around the corner and Eric Crown says over here Bitcoin dominance he's a air Crown is known to be one of the best uh you know ta guys out there and he says Bitcoin dominance is about to fall off a cliff which means all season is coming coinbase institutional exchange to introduce Perpetual Futures contracts for a iix BT peanut and vet okay just in case you didn't know and it's an DB over says Trump receptive to the idea of Reserve with coins founded in us now this is a pretty good Alex over here says you know why like like uh why are we bullish on American coins well because Trump is America everything America First tariffs if you're not doing your company in America you know Pro let's support American things let's bring everything and that's great that's what you should be doing as a president in my opinion um it makes a lot of sense so coins like salana xrp I I don't know why we talk about usdc like oh we're going to be bullish you can't invest in usdc it's a stable coin but uh cardono uh these other the ones should do really well uh you should benefit exceptionally well from being based in the United States it's funny because uh historically it's always been really really hard and everyone has been encouraged to not create a crypto and be us-based company but as has said he wants to make United States the crypto capital of the world and so you would want to be a crypto-based company in the United States that's what I'm hoping right I'm hoping that everything becomes much more favorable that Americans can participate in things like defi freely things like public sales and idos and lcos you know all these things that uh that we're doing that have historically had to exclude Americans would be very nice so JP Morgan and for my American friends out there I think that's coming very very soon speaking to my legal council recently so JP Morgan sees potential of three 3 to8 billion doll windfall for salon and xrp with ETF approvals looming as the SEC decision approaches xrp is climbing and soul is also climbing you'll see we'll talk about those in just a minute here this is a funny little GIF over here uh or GIF or whatever you call them like this is a this SEC approving ETFs uh after the Trump Administration okay uh poly market pricing the odds of a ripple ETF at 71% so Ripple I think is going to like blow a lot of Minds you know a lot of us who've been in the space for a long time we don't like Ripple we think it's not crypto enough but like I don't actually even hold any Ripple But like after so so my cousin who bought her first 50 $50 of crypto recently it was xrp right and it just goes to show you like that's the first thing that she chose to buy out of everything not Bitcoin not ethereum not salana it was xrp I mean that tells me something you know that and I've heard this before from everybody especially in America is like buying xrp and as you can see in America on coinbase it's a second day in a row where X xrp spot volume is greater by 2x than Bitcoin Bitcoin trading volume at 1.2 billion and xrp at 2 billion pretty crazy doctor over here says you want to hear something crazy xrp will take over eth in market cap this year only a few understand the power of xrp in the cycle I don't know guys let me know in the comments below if you think it's true will xrp flip eth let me know let me know what you guys think I don't think it's crazy I don't think it's crazy I think I think that if an xrp ETF gets approved I think that xrp ETF will outperform the ethereum ETF I do I I I I think that I don't know I I just think that I just from everything I hear I think that so I'm reconsidering I don't even know where I'm going to store xrp I you know you can't put it in metamask you can't put it in in Phantom I can't put it on my my ledger or treasure for sure so maybe I do something like that I don't know and of course there's always concerns but this is not you know like this isn't really you don't really have to care about this but yeah a lot of xrp is held by Wales and by the company itself you know that's never going to change they just it's been a highly centralized company for a long time at full disclosure I am an investor in Ripple I have equity in the company itself uh so yeah that was uh done a while back so that was nice and you can see that it has a right now fully deleted valuation of 320 8 billion if you're interested in the Ripple ecosystem if Ripple turns out to be some crazy [\u00a0__\u00a0] that that's that starts flying maybe the coins and the ecosystem I didn't even really know certainly didn't even pay attention to any of the ecosystem developments in Ripple until this video there is one meme coin if you guys are interested I haven't bought it yet I don't think I'm going to buy it but I'll tell you about it in case you're interested and it kind of makes sense it's called xrp Army and that's what is so strong about xrp is the xrp army so the mcoin makes sense to me anyway I just don't I'm just not going to buy it I'm I'm not going to buy it because I don't mostly because I don't want to bridge liquidity over there and figure out how to use the xrp blockchain I mean maybe I'm resistant to something that you know would be mistake but for me I'm not going to buy it but if you want to go for it you know okay next one so that's one of the uh likely ETFs to happen you know a lot of people saying salana was going to be the next one right lot of people out there think Sal is be the next one but let's check this out so Phantom wallets congratulations Phantom just raised $150 million a$3 billion valuation from seoa and Paradigm crazy salana despite the meme cooldown is still the leading chain when it comes to new users followed BYU and Bas so salana is the other ETF that we're expecting right and it's also dominating the whole AI agent category which is really popular as well and bitwise one of the ETF issuers forecast $6,6 36 per soul in 2030 it's like 220 right now so you're talking about like another 30 is it 30X from here that's pretty good it's pretty good you know like uh you definitely have some soul in your bag for sure Blue Chip but Bloomberg thinks that maybe we don't see a soul ETF until 2026 potentially that becomes a bare Market Maybe not maybe have a super cycle I don't know but the reason Bloomberg thinks that is because there's still this debate with the SEC currently about salana being in security until that gets cleared out which it probably will but I don't know how soon but it probably will but maybe it'll be you know 2026 when so it's probably more likely you know and and James is from Bloomberg he says we'll know for sure in a couple of weeks if this has a legit shot at getting approved if we see the SEC acknowledge this application for Litecoin ETF from Canary so the next one we're going to talk about is Litecoin I know Litecoin what yeah it's so Litecoin probably has a better chance of getting an ETF approved this year or before salana actually ladies and gentlemen poly markets has it a 61% chance of getting approved this is Litecoin making a post here say me watching half the crypto Market lose their [\u00a0__\u00a0] over Litecoin getting an ETF before them and James says again James from Bloomberg he's been on the channel before to be clear a VI salana or an xrp ETF approval from the SEC as a matter of when and not if at this point but Litecoin might get through first largely because of the lack of accusations that Litecoin is a security from the SEC right the SEC has never ever gone after Litecoin calling it a security likely that Litecoin does get an ETF you know it's significantly cheaper than other things I mean sit at number 23 it's significantly cheaper than Dogecoin significantly cheaper than salana significantly cheaper than Bitcoin you know maybe it's not a bad Play Still 67% down from all-time highs and this thing might get an ETF I mean as Dana says over here H I guess Bitcoin is gold and Litecoin is arguably silver as one of the o altcoins but I have to say if there's going to be a a Litecoin ETF then there should be a do a doge ETF as well doge is number seven crypto with a market cap of 56 billion and Litecoin is number 19 with a market cap of 9.6 billion as Jimmy says over here doge is under consideration for a future grayscale product including Doge would attract a b investor base help legitimize Dogecoin bring it to institutional investors get us closer to Doge ETF much wow this this he must have clipped this from a grayscale product offering which is interesting that Ai 16z and virtuals is also on here as well also Dogecoin I think this is interesting a6z and virtual as well uh being considered for a new product I guess from grayscale but so this Doge one is still quite far off from reality poly markets has a 37% chance of it getting improved in 2025 and to wrap it up Nate gachi over here says that you know he's like the ETF guy he says that we're basically entering into the world of the Wild wild west of ETFs we don't really know until we're going to know what's coming up how this new Administration is going to handle all this we do know that it's going to be better and more friendly than the prior Administration but we don't know exactly how quick fast it will come we will have to see and I'm excited to watch this unfold I've been in this space for so long it constantly blows my mind it's the best place to be I'm going to see you guys on Monday Monday's inauguration day have a fantastic weekend ladies and gentlemen I really appreciate it I'll catch you in the next one bye-bye"
