    "transcript": " we might have just seen the craziest weekend in cryptocurrencies history Bitcoin at one point hit new all-time highs we had the president drop a memec coin we've never seen anything like that from such a predominant public figure and then on top of that he goes ahead and launches a Melania meme coin about 24 to 36 hours later it was Madness in the crypto markets we're going to go over everything in this video and honestly where's the money rotating next you know trumpcoin sitting at about $40 billion market cap a lot of people have already made so much money on this coin that you need to be looking at the next rotation and some of them are already playing out but we're going to look at the narratives that I think catch money off the back of this and especially if Trump does come through with an executive order on crypto whether it's the Strategic Reserve or whatever the case is so we're going to dive into the narratives to look at next in this video and the coins that I think got their liquidity sucked away from the Trump coin that could see money flow right back back in so let's go ahead and dive into it guys like the video down below subscribe to the channel for more every day and every single week here on in the game we have you covered from meme coins AI gaming and more and a big shout out to all of our sponsors here on in the game if you're looking for a place to trade I would be using blof fin blof fin is the best spot No kyc Easy in Easy Out deposits and withdrawals bonus if you sign up there's going to be a little bit of usdt topped up to your account as well it is just the number one place to trade that's where I place all of of my trades and a big shout out to our sponsors fomo Ledger funo Moon tropica and a shout out to Moon Tropa another big partnership and I love that Moon tropica is leaning into the AI and it's a big strength I've talked about Moon Tropa and they lean into the culture and the narratives very well they have all the meme coin characters and now they've partnered up with neural AI they've partnered up with repy AI to leverage their language models for high performance API infrastructure to enhance its gaming ecosystem so very good to see Moon tropica leaning into the AI space and a big shout out to Moon tropica our longest standing sponsor on this show and very bullish genuinely on the future of c and moon tropica so let's go ahead and dive into it I mean obviously the uh the elephant in the room is the Trump token now you know if you watch my last video I played this almost perfectly because I was just early I sat on the I was on the couch on Friday night they launch lach this thing I got in early I made absolute massive profits I still have a bag left in uh at that time it was like a 12 billion market cap on that video now it's sitting at $38 billion market cap and I've kind of left a moon bag in here absolutely was one of the biggest trades I've ever caught but it's hard to catch all these things right and and you can't kick yourself over it but I also think we have to lower our you know a lot of people faded it that were even at the computer at this time and there's the left curve the mid curve and the right curve and I think this cycle we have to be so much more on either the left or the right curve you can't midc curve these things you can't just let them fade you can't not get exposure to it so whether or not you had bought this token or did Meteora LPS like I had mentioned on the video if you were late to the Token uh you know the left curve is what if Trump flips Bitcoin uh mid curve is like no this is not good no altseason rug it's over ninth inning that means that you're sidelined right and then the right curve is all of our coins are going so much higher no matter what you have to live on the left or the right curve do not mid curve these types of things and you know as the watch King points out Trump makes 500 million overnight in crypto and you think he's not going to you know lean policies towards crypto and you know change the short-term capital gain tax he's just going to give away all that money that he potentially just made off of this coin uh he says crime is legal and you're crying in the casino look at yourself so yeah this is just another example like crypto is going to crypto and we saw people over the weekend Mr Beast saying he's not going to release a coin Mark Cuban saying he might look into the idea he thought it was a very appealing idea despite some of his disdain sometimes towards Donald Trump so you know this could springboard into so much more and if you paid attention the Trump memes website is talking about a series of meme coins like is there going to be a Barron meme coin is there going to be these other m memes that spin off of this we already have Trump and Melania so it is a crazy time in crypto and I think this cycle it's like and a lot of us on this channel we want utility coins to pump right of course I want to see my gaming bags eventually do well the good products the good infrastructures I want to see my AI infrastructure stuff do very well my AI agents my meme coins whatever the case is rwa but at the end of the day like this industry is all about dollars and the dollars are going to flow into these types of opportunities no matter how stupid we think they are or not so we have to be ready for these opportunities whenever they come up and I do think you know we're not going to see one that runs as hard as Trump just did but there are going to be opportunities that pop up throughout the cycle and you can't be sitting there you know upset that you missed it because there's always another play now this one was crazy there's always another play so we're going to be looking at the next plays we're going to be talking about how you can prepare yourself for if this was to never happen again but on top of that where's the money going to flow back into because a lot of people made profits here and they're going to rotate those into coins potentially on the salana network we're already seeing it happen actually so we'll talk about that in just a second and on top of that uh M3 M3 pumped big time over the weekend uh if you know what we're talking about here this is the native meme coin to the Meteora platform so if we go look at M3 M3 it's up 62% this week the reason being is ironically and honestly just very cool to see we we obviously used Meteora for the LPS on this coin cuz the volume was super high as seen in the last video but they launched this coin in collab with Meteora if you looked at the charts and the Wicks on something like a bullex you can see it's a Meteora chart it it was crazy so they used Meteora in collab with this launch so Trump is in our court are you Stak so a pretty cool collaboration there for one of our top meme coins we've been calling out recently in M3 M3 and then on top of that we see Bank of America's CEO today saying that the the banking industry will Embrace crypto if Regulators allow it we're going so much higher like a lot of people when they saw this Trump thing come out they're like ah bull market cancelled this is the top we're not going to see altcoins pump this honestly just stimulated the market what happened here it didn't take liquidity out of everything permanently AI agents are probably going to get money back into them meme coins are about to probably run like the Cycle's going to continue what he just did is drop a stimulus check to the crypto Community because everyone now has more Capital to play with if you got involved so I'm going to go over a little bit of news across l1's gaming and then we're going to talk about the coins that I'm looking to scoop up and that are already already being scooped up that we've talked about on this channel that I would be looking at right now so let's let's dive into it we see Avalanche partnering up with athe they dropped this today they're delighted to announce a strategic partnership with athe to support infra build uh infra build AI if you but build like hoddle uh projects in the Avalanche ecosystem with their $100 million ecosystem fund let's dive into it and they kind of go over how this is going to work they're going to FastTrack projects to $100 million ecosystem fund integrate AI Community to strengthen the ecosystem so a big partnership here for Avalanche and obviously like what happened this weekend took place on salana so a lot of these other chains are very stagnant in these other top l1s soie ton Avalanche Tron Ada they're all pretty much sideways like over the weekly nothing's up more than 10% and nothing's down more than 5% like these things just trended sideways I actually think that's a position of strength especially because the salana ecosystem was having some problems because of the congestion now salana is going to be fine but I think these other l1s have so much upside from here especially with games like Off the Grid They just added their scump skin uh if you're like me by the way and if you're an MLG person you definitely know who scump is he's one of the all-time greats in the Call of Duty scene they actually just added his skin to the game this last weekend and it actually caught a lot of eyes because there's not a scump skin in Call of Duty his native game but you know Off the Grid went ahead and gave him this awesome looking skin with crazy details so this got a lot of Buzz across the community when it comes to Call of Duty which is actually good for Off the Grid main net launch coming up token launch coming up I think this could honestly stimulate the gaming market like we kind of just saw Trump stimulate the entire Market we also have zentry diving into AI where gaming and AI converge to create Endless Possibilities zaii our agentic layer will be at the Forefront of everyday reality changing into a living MMO RPG with the verse uh with the birth of Alicia AI so this is their official AI the agentic layer catalyzing the human agentic economy so I would go look at all this a lot of the technicalities you you'd really have to know how these AI agents work however I think that it's good that we see zentry one of my favorite undervalued gaming bags if we just go look at the market cap here it's held up so well I'm honestly impressed it's held this about 3 Cent level the entire time even when liquidity got sucked out of the market whenever we saw the big dip down to the low 90s when Trump just came through and everyone moved their money into trumpcoin even zentry still been hanging around this 3 Cent level $180 million market cap I think this is a fantastic position for whenever gaming and overall the altcoin scene gets money flowing back into it because if we look at the one-day chart cuz now we're going to flow into what am I looking at to buy where do I think money is going to start rotating and I have a case study already that that's playing out as we speak and it's a token we've been giving you guys since $30 million on this channel so I'll talk about that in just a second but we see stuff uh like musket the Elon Musk meme coin that makes sense right so this is like the musk family meme coin this one's up 55% today well why is that it has the musk narrative he was on stage yesterday you know doing all these crazy Antics we're not going to talk too much about that but he was doing all these crazy things on stage and he went viral on Twitter because of it right so the musket meme coin is up 5 5% why it's on salana so that makes sense the money is just naturally rotating into these types of memes we've seen a lot of Baron Trump meme coins uh World Baron token like come up and and really do well over the last 24 hours but those aren't really going to be here to stay so the ones you're seeing here fog makes sense it's on salana 52% over the last 24 hours so you're seeing money start to flow back in to altcoins now like stuff on eth and stuff on some other chains is up you know Wilder world's up 8% we see kit protocol up 8% pump AI which is on salana up 8% Ronin up 6% Prime up 5% so everything is gradually bouncing but what you would notice here is the top three coins on this list are all salana meme coins and that is where the majority of the money is filtering at this point in time I had tweeted this the day that he launched the meme coin about 2 hours before he launched the mem coin but I said memes into AI into rwa into gaming I think that's the rotational forecast now Trump could have switched things up which we're about to get into but I think that was the forecast we were looking at on Friday night before this meme coin dropped right meme coins money flows to AI money flows to rwa post strategic reserve and we're seeing Trump kind of legitimized the angle for the US and crypto and then into gaming as we see big tge like infin God's big main net and token launches with gunzilla it all made sense right meme season Came Out Swinging Ai and agents controlling the current narrative post Trump inauguration rwa runs and then gaming runs late q1 due to bullish catalysts upcoming that are long overdue well then we saw Trump come through the door and bring through this token which definitely did change things up but if you read the tea leaves right Trump's team did just buy a $100 million of crypto yesterday I think this strategic Reserve announcement is coming right around the corner there were some rumors that today he's going to sign some big executive orders who really knows but they did just drop a $100 million on eth bitcoin a chain link Tron and Ena now of course I think it's good like you you could you could tail these tokens because you know they did just dump a lot of money into it but to be completely honest for the ones in in crypto the only one that would really maybe be appealing is Tron and a like I'm I've never been a big chain link investor uh Ena Bitcoin and eth obviously that's very good they dropped a lot of money into both of those assets but a 4.7 mil and Tron 4.7 mil a is just a great top-of-the-line you know lending platform I think that does make sense for them to be in the Strategic reserve and they're legitimizing that as a platform they'd recommend but number two Tron they have meme coins underneath Tron but however I just think this is more important for the upcoming you know legislation executive orders that Trump is going to push forward so what tokens would I be looking at in this current market I have a few and the one example I'm going to provide here is MLG and I'm going to zoom this chart out because we really need to see um what happened with this token now all right we got all the way up here to I believe all-time highs of 140 $145 million market cap and we had called this token before the initial pump we called it around this $30 million level right here on this channel so you got to ro write it up all the way to those levels and we got as low here on these dips as $43 million market cap on the 19th of January why is this well the Trump coin is on salana every everyone was selling bags to buy Trump at the time like maybe you weren't liquid enough maybe you didn't have enough money on the soul chain maybe you were in a couple different memes but of course you wanted exposer to Trump so a lot of people dumped this day uh from the 17th probably around this time you could see the just the catastrophic liquidity to the downside here on this coin but if you had just bought this token post Trump you could have bought this yesterday and currently sitting at 106% Gainer it's back at a $100 million market cap so this is a perfect example of a meme coin that was demonstrating strength that people are now rotating profits back into and I think if the market continues to the upside this is the type of a token that's about to make new all-time highs in the coming days because the momentum the ball was in their court for the foreseeable future at the time they started pumping and now you're seeing this coin up 100% over 24 hours I I think MLG the leg up here is going to be huge because of now the new liquidity and the liquidity that took money out that just wanted to rotate back in it's still going to come back in here and I think we see new all-time Highs coming up for the MLG token so that is a perfect example of a salon coin had momentum but now you're seeing that momentum resurface because people are moving their Trump profits back into it so what other coins could we look at to potentially take this opportunity and be able to to park liquidity into for the next leg up so what we'll do is we'll go back to Nexus and we will take a look across the board and honestly let's focus on the narrative that was just hot which is AI agents and honestly AI agent coins have dipped quite a bit and they're starting to recover personally speaking I'd be looking at stuff like virtuals protocol I'd be looking at stuff I mean AI 16z literally has pumped since this morning very unfortunate that was one that I had kind of highlighted but right now I'd looking at virtuals it's down like 50% since alltime highs that is definitely one I don't think this is dead I've seen some stuff on the timeline virtual is not not going to come back that narrative is over I definitely don't think so I mean AI agents were the main squeeze until Trump dropped this meme coin but some of the strongest gainers over the last 24 hours have been AI agents we have ai 16z agent YP Zer bro Ava like agents AI is up 20% over the last 24 hours this narratives not going away so I would be looking at some of these strength coins as far as the salana based or even base like with virtuals stuff like that that's what I'd be looking at is allocating into strength in the AI agent space But even going down the line I think GPU I think neural Ai and I think heart are all at very good prices so as far as my AI I'd be looking at AI agents I'd be very very focused on Virtual I I think this is the number one one AI agent by today simply because it is down so much from all-time highs if we look at the monthly chart this thing hit $5 it's 270 right now this narrative is still alive and well although we're distracted right now with the Trump narrative I think that this is a no-brainer so I'd be looking at virtual and like I said unfortunate that AI 16z pumped so much today cuz this is one I had highlighted overnight to bring onto the show that would be one of my top buys however I think you still have a lot of value if you're getting into something like an agents AI at a $6 million market cap that is also on salana which is why some liquidity is filtering over there so I'd say from a large cap perspective I'm looking at virtual from a low cap perspective I'm looking at something like agent which is also like I said on the salana Chain if we look at the monthly charts here this got up to uh 1 and A5 cents so like a $15 million market cap so this is down 60% from its all-time highs I think it can ab absolutely reclaim that over the next couple of weeks especially if the market remains strong so that is definitely one I'd be looking at let's go back to the main watch list here and we will take a look at obviously I think that gaming is going to run end of q1 if you want allocation or exposure to the things that are I think going to be the narrative I think beam I think Avalanche as well as superverse those would be my top three that I would be allocating into right now and then as far as meme coins honestly like for me MLG is a big Focus I'm looking at Calvin at 4 million honestly this was the most impressive chart to me because if you look at the Calvin chart here on the 15 minutes this thing got hammered around the time of trump this is the day that Trump launched it went from 6 mil all the way down to about 2 mil it's bounced back up to $4.3 million market cap I think it reclaims these $6 million levels over the course of the next 24 to 36 hours and then it's right back on track to where it was going it's an AI agent it's a meme coin at the same time it's going to have narratives inside of it that trades and and burns some of the supply I can't say too much about that part because it's going to be taking Supply off the market of a meme coin which is going to be very bullish but it encompasses multiple narratives it's on salana AI agent animal coin so this is definitely one that I am eyeballing at this point in time and then from an rwa perspective I'm keeping it in the same boat that I had brought you last week I like lingo at $43 million market cap it's fully diluted there's no more tokens coming into circulation that's what I would be looking at at this point in time and I have to mention although I didn't bring it up now because we talked about it earlier zentry at $180 million market cap that is another one I would absolutely be looking at at these levels so to recap the coins I'm most focused on right now virtual MLG Calvin zentry super beam I think Prime because of the AI narrative as well with parallel coming up right around the corner and then when you're looking into the AI Niche AI 16z it is up quite a bit today so I would wait to see if that cools off just a little bit but then moving down the ladder my utility plays with GPU neural and heart all got hit pretty hard over the last week and I think will make huge recoveries so that's what I'd be looking at I think that's about 10 tokens that I think money will flow back into and I really am focused on the salana coins stuff like what we're seeing with MLG this is going to happen across many more projects that lost liquidity over the last week this narrative is not done yet people like FaZe Banks and and Jakey myself and other influencers out there are super heavy on this coin and that's why you're seeing the strength and I think that's why you're going to see stuff like Calvin like virtual like ageny AI zentry these coins that had strength previously are about to get a little bit of a stimulus and liquidity coming right back into them so guys that's going to do it for today's video like the video down below subscribe to the channel for more every single week and every day here on in the game we're going to have
