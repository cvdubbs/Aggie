    "transcript": " the market has kicked up since our last video earlier this week We were trending around 80K Today we are trending right around 84K We got upwards of 86K on a little bit of a news pump but we did see a sell-off but we're hovering pretty nicely around these high 83 levels on Bitcoin as of today And the big question is when does the bull run resume Because firmly I have the opinion that this bull run is not over And I think what we're seeing right now actually resembles previous chart patterns from previous bull runs And we're going to talk about that in this video of when does the bull run kick back into effect And also when is the time to start nibbling at some altcoins I actually think that if you have a stable coin stack that should be probably beginning to happen at this point We'll go over some of my favorite altcoin buys Also why gaming is ramping up for a run whenever the market turns around And I'm going to show you the trend of why gaming usually gets hot at the absolute worst times but some of the catalysts coming up could lead to a pump in the altcoin gaming sector whenever the market turns around Let's go ahead and jump right into it guys Like the video and of course subscribe to the channel down below for more every day and every single week here on In the Game We have you covered from gaming AI meme coins RWAs and more across the entire market as well A big shout out to our sponsors here on In the Game We have some amazing sponsors from Medieval Empires We have Cradle Games Moon Tropica Fun Tico Ledger as well as our exchange partners You can check out our exchange partners down below I have been trading a ton in this market and I would absolutely recommend to check out Blofin Blofin has tons of pairs and also no KYC easy

can trade here anywhere in the world and that is super important Check out Blow Fin down below This is where I'm doing all of my longs and shorts in this market And of course coming up with our software product here inhouse with Nexus which by the way covers the entire market It covers you know the trending tokens onchain metrics We have watch list You can track your portfolio top to bottom across 50 plus chains We actually have per onchain equities coming up soon No KYC fully decentralized You custody your funds So you can start getting involved with Nexus down below And our trading will also be going live here very soon So if you want a centralized exchange I would check out Blofin If you want a decentralized exchange we have Nexus coming up right around the corner Now let's jump into it guys Obviously like I said the market did see a little bit of an uptick earlier this week on some like press conferences as well as some rate cut type of situations And what we're seeing right now is now kind of just trending around that 83k level But we see here we rose quite nicely off of this 81 level all the way up to 87 on the 19th So two days ago we have seen a little bit of a downtrend here because unfortunately in this market even if it's good news right now people every event has turned into a sell the news event It's quite frustrating and it does make you wonder what is going to be that catalyst that actually catapults us into what we would consider a real riskon bull market And honestly you know I think right now people are overly bearish Like what we've seen on the timeline recently everyone's bearish and they think that they're smart for being bearish And of course like from the crypto summit I had mentioned that I think that was a big sell the news event and it did end up being that And you know painfully we all want the market to go up But when is this market going to turn around I think there's a couple of factors to keep in mind of like in the thumbnail when do we switch back on that button that says the bull run is resumed Well right now personally I think the bearish trade is overcrowded Like everyone's bearish on the timeline and it you know they think that that's the smart play but at this point in time it's an overcrowded trade Every time people are euphoric in this market it seems to go the other way And right now people have been awfully bearish in the market So let's see what happens over the next couple of weeks But I agree with what Zenica tweeted here and you know everyone's waiting for quantitive easing So basically you know easing on what's going on with the money supply and not tightening because that does give us more of a risk-on environment and especially in a market like crypto But wouldn't it make sense to frontr run that And presumably that other people have thought of this wouldn't it make sense to frontr run them too Just saying So I do think this is a time to start at least planting some of your stable coin seeds into top projects and the narratives that you want exposure into For me I really have just narrowed down my portfolio to L1's gaming AI RWA and just a couple of meme coins that I think will come through the door and actually make a comeback at some point in time And also the recession talks Okay we are in massive talks about recession and I think that when people start talking about recession it's probably getting priced in as we speak So I do think if you have a good altcoin buy list here or a good altcoin watch list this could be the time to at least start nibbling put 10 to 20% of your stable coins into the market because some of these prices are absolutely criminally low And as we go through some of this news I will talk about the coins and the projects that I think are the best DCAs in this market So let's roll through in some of these narratives And we're going to start with gaming of course because if you're paying attention in the gaming space right now this is actually the hottest narrative by far Uh and you know you could laugh at me in the comments and say \"Well you know Hustle nothing's really happening in the gaming space right Like we're actually the the altcoins are down every altcoin's down Okay like the climate that we're in right now does not provoke positive price action on gaming But at the same time we are seeing the attention shift in gaming's favor like crazy at this point in time And it is interesting I just want to before we even go into some of the news and what's happening in the gaming market gaming got hot and I'm going to point out these chart patterns Every single time that gaming gets hot it is in areas right here from you know April 2021 to July 2021 That's when Axi Infiniti initially took off Well that is in a downtrend of the market right People really flocked into onchain games that could make you money while the market was going down And then here about November 2021 this was the height of uh Defi Kingdoms Defi Kingdoms was absolutely rocketing at this point in time The Juul token was $20 And then from here downward all the way up to April So all the way down to here we we saw a trend that gaming was hot from about December 2021 and right at the end of the 2021 cycle at about 67K all the way down here to where you know the Ponzi of Kbata actually ended which was about April of 2022 So there was a four-month time period where the market was in just a pure downtrend but onchain games like Pegaxi and Crobata were extremely hot at that point in time And then of course what we're seeing right now is onchain games are getting very hot at this point in time while the market is dipping So Gamefy the financialized side of gaming is hot at every single point of the market where we see these big pullbacks in a bullish climate right We are seeing an overall what I would consider a bull market kind of forming around us and we we've been in one but I think we're in a bull market pullback similar to that one we just looked at here in 2021 But gaming always gets hot at this point in time We have onchain heroes which is basically a Ponzi gamefi game which has been the number one application on abstract We see stuff like yesterday with DeFi dungeons and we'll talk about that here in just a second but just read between the lines right now and see when the market's up or down People are still playing these games The memecoin casino might take over the attention span whenever the market's up but right now is a great time to be looking across the board what gaming ecosystems you want to plant seeds into We see off the grid with 234,000 active wallets yesterday 1.57 million incoming transactions And the number one altcoin that I would be DCAing from a top-of-the-line perspective right now is Avalanche Avalanche has everything going for it They have off the grid Maple Story Also if we just look in between the lines here beyond gaming BlackRock is building with Avalanche and their AUM just reached $50 million So we're seeing a lot of adoption over here on Avalanche And you might be thinking well this isn't an onchain game It is an onchain game It's in test net right now And we've actually seen just over the last couple of days an off-thegrid pro pack sold for 3.5K over the counter And then we see here an off-thegrid player recently sold two in-game items here the Kite Legacy and the Kestrel Legacy for $400 These are basically CSGO skins but fully onchain We also see games and ecosystems underneath Immutable which is Raven Quest with 33,000 active wallets over the course of the last 7 days This is basically the closest thing we have seen to a Runescape on chain and they have been absolutely crushing it which is just showing you right now in this market Gaming is thriving We go look at another ecosystem here with Infinagods a record amount of in-game spend in Thor's Banquet the recent most uh the most recent 3-day live ops event There was 1,834 sunk into the web store on in-game items And that is in total god token spend And then yesterday the big fiasco on the timeline we saw DeFi Dungeons which is basically kind of like Salana's version if I have to consider my description of it It's Salana's version of DeFi Kingdoms in a way It's going to be a gamefi yield farming type of game that bases itself off DeFi And these games do very well but it shows you the attention People think that gaming and crypto gaming the narrative is dead but there's numbers like this but there's no financial side of it right We don't see people making crazy money yet on Off the Grid or Raven Quest or Maple Story cuz they're not fully on chain yet But at this point in time in markets like this people want escapes which is showing you why the market does well in GameFi in the actual financial side in a market like this because the market's going down people want to resort to be able to try to make some yield or make some money And we looked yesterday DeFi Dungeons this has it had a $3 million cap on their fund raise and it was 43 times oversubscribed It is an onchain game on Salana like I mentioned kind of like Defi Kingdoms There was $130 million committed into this pre-sale Absolutely crazy demand And it does beg the question like onchain games while the market is in this type of a climate are absolutely the play We saw onchain heroes play out DeFi dungeons play out Of course with that amount of fund raise people didn't get too many tokens but I am excited to see that full ecosystem go live and just see what happens But this all leads me to believe you know we have real and I'm going to be just quite frank here We have real products okay with Offtheg Grid Raven Quest Maple Story There's tons of games out there that are web 3 games not necessarily fully onchain den style games like some of these DeFi dungeons or what we're about to talk about here in just a second I think that it's important to note these are the longer term plays that are going to catapult the overall industry forward So to treat them like it has to happen today or tomorrow or next week is unfair These are AAA products like Off the Grid that need time to develop And I think that when this goes fully onchain we will see a big spark in gaming altcoins And because Off the Grid is operating on Avalanche this is why I want a piece of the Avalanche ecosystem of course And just moving on down the line here when we look at what could be another opportunity around the corner right We see DeFi Dungeons I think participating in DeFi Dungeons if you get in early even if you didn't get a part of the token launch I think that could be a really good play because it's going to have DeFi mechanics You could be able to make some money there But there's another onchain game going live here off the heels of Onchain Heroes in DeFi Dungeons This is Dungeons of Fortune This is the one that's getting the most hype after these two have kind of done their raises and had Onchain Heroes season 1 and now this gold vault launch We see Dungeons of Fortune They are now opened up their pre-sale registration So you can go check out Fortune Dungeons on Twitter and get involved here if you want to try to frontr run and get involved in another upcoming onchain game which is definitely going to be leading leaning into the DeFi narrative So that would be the next play here But most importantly when DeFi Dungeons is fully live I'll give a tutorial how I'm going to navigate it because it's a short-term play Like if you are going to think that you can just stack your money here and make money for the rest of the market that's not going to be the case So I will go over what my strategy is inside of this ecosystem when this goes live because I did pledge some money I got some tokens from the gold vault from the launch they did on Meteora So we'll see what happens going forward here in this ecosystem And like I said I'll give you a walkthrough of how I'm maximizing my yield in this ecosystem And then a little bit more gaming news and then I'll talk about the other tokens that I'm looking to accumulate We see Zy and I know a lot of people here got involved with the Zy Tiny Century Keys They're basically like the nodes of their ecosystem round two and they just had their first snapshot for an airdrop So there are instructions here down below to be able to claim your airdrop in this tweet So you can see here that this will be the first airdrop going out to the tiny Sentry Key holders Sentry keys were like $40 I think these are going to ROI very nicely So if you participated in the tiny Sentry Key sale the first snapshot for airdrop has been announced And we can see here on Yaku Corp which is a game inside of the Z ecosystem there is instructions here on how this airdrop will play out We also saw the Z ecosystem launch Ryen So Ryan is kind of like their onchain reward system for actual Steam games So you can actually connect your Steam account here be able to earn rewards straight up from your just gaming participation across the board which really I'm going to use the word decentralizes or unmonopizes the side of oh I have to choose one onchain game here to be able to make money or else I'm not going to be able to make money Well Ryen from XAI or Z is actually really disrupting that model And you can actually come in here earn points across your Steam account for the things that you're playing the trophies or the achievements that you earn You can enter contests play games get achievements and earn points So this is basically turning every game into a web 3 game with reward mechanisms So bullish updates there in the ZY ecosystem And then another bullish update in the immutable ecosystem because we saw Raven Quest here and like you see this is built on the immutable ZK EVM We see Treeverse which is also built on Immutable is now available on the iOS app store Like I said I'm going to check this out this weekend I have some more time over the weekend A little you know less hectic with the market and just content and trying to build out with Nexus and getting trading live over here But I'm going to jump into Treeverse here this weekend and see exactly what all the hype is about But just looking at the altcoin market here like I said there's really only a couple of sectors I'd becaing into I think Avalanche at $18 that's a phenomenal DCA I would definitely be willing to put 10 15% a piece of 10 or 15% of my stable coins into a couple of projects right now One of them would 100% be Avalanche I love Tao at these prices 244 This was trading at over $400 whenever it got announced on Coinbase Now it's taken a 41% dip If I'm choosing one AI play in this market it's absolutely tow at these prices And then moving down the ladder here I think nobrainer Superverse You know Superverse just continues to add more and more partners And whenever I'm getting involved with gaming tokens now and I've preached this for a long time but you'll see it moving forward I don't really I will participate in stuff like DeFi Dungeons or Dungeons of Fortune or Onchain Heroes or I will be dejing the assets in off the grid and inside of these ecosystems However I don't know that I'm going to be buying a lot of these assets in an effort to profit off the assets themselves more so profiting off of participation inside the ecosystem Whereas my overall investment thesis has firmly shifted into I only want exposure into ecosystems stuff like Beam Prime Ronin Superverse Avalanche You know looking down the ladder you could even look at Wilder World They have multiple games in their ecosystem I still love Zentree I think Zentri at 80 million is a crazy low price to be able to DCA into what I consider to be a top ecosystem Partnered up with Ronin Their Ragnarok IPs over there They just bridge their token over to Ronin as well A lot of good stuff going on underneath that ecosystem But for now that's about everything I'm willing to DCA at this point I want ecosystems I want projects with blockchains that operate multiple games stuff like Immutable Beam Ronin you know uh Avalanche whatever the case is Or I want ecosystems or studios that have a numerous amount of games under them Stuff like Zy Superverse stuff like Wilderworld Echelon Prime these all have numerous games inside their ecosystem So you're not just betting on one product Like it's like going down the ladder here It's very hard to say \"Oh Pixelmon's going to be the winner of the cycle or or Crown or any of these games You're you're shooting dice at that point in time I'd rather bet on the ecosystems that these games are building with.\" And that's my thesis moving forward And then I do love Tao at these prices I just think TA is dirt cheap at 244 just compared off of where it was after their Coinbase listing before the market went to crap over the last couple of weeks So that's what I'm looking at in this market right now guys I know my thesis on gaming hasn't really changed but I think these time periods is where it builds conviction that when the market ramps back up and we see the real products go on chain like Off the Grid like Raven Quest Maple Story which are three of my top games that I think could lead us into a true a true resurgence and true altcoin gaming bull market When those things go live in the correct market it's going to be these types of successes in the bare market that are leaving clues Like we see a hund00 million plus in interest in certain onchain games that are most likely going to be Ponzi's Like these are Ponzi games at the end of the day They're here for short-term dopamine Get in get out Early incumbents are going to make more than the late incumbents But that's fine in this type of a market That is what people are leaning into because meme coins are dead There's no onchain casino right now This is the onchain casino So we're going to lean into this while the market is like this But this is showing you liquidity has not dried up in the gaming space And I'm firmly confident when the right products launch we're going to see an overall altcoin gaming bounce Probably like we haven't seen since 2021 cuz it's long overdue The last time we saw the gaming sector run was in February of 2024 13 months ago So this is 13 months of pent up just red dips bad sentiment a lot of games that have folded but I think we're going to make out very well once this narrative does turn around So guys like the video down below subscribe to the channel for more Next week I'm going to be out with a lot more videos We're going to give tutorials across ecosystems We're going to be talking about the market We're going to be talking about different narratives coins that I'm still convicted into everything that you need to know in this time period to ramp up for when the full-blown bull does kick back into effect So guys like and subscribe I'll see y'all on the next one As always play well my friends"
