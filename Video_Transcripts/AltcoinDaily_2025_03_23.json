    "transcript": " as the Bitcoin price consolidates from this recent sell-off and as I'm searching for quality crypto coins to invest in here are five altcoins under $1 on my radar in 2025 and really the first question we have to ask ourselves is can the Bitcoin price recover because we have just seen the highest Bitcoin outflows from exchanges since July of 2024 so the last time we saw Bitcoin outflows of almost this magnitude was July 2024 the Bitcoin price was around $55,000 per coin and although we would go on to see a lower high and then a lower low outflows of this magnitude are always significant because they tend to mark seller exhaustion meaning eventually just like when price goes up and we see buyer exhaustion eventually there's no more new money at the moment there's no more new buyers willing to buy at these prices same thing happens during sell-offs and while that does not mean we won't see a lower low with the Bitcoin price I'm not a fortune teller i don't know what the Bitcoin price will do tomorrow and neither do you outflows of this significance from exchanges tend to mark seller exhaustion and when we compare that to stable coins entering the market the only reason you need to put money into stable coins is either to farm yield or to have those stable coins to eventually buy Bitcoin buy crypto look what's happening just like here the comparison of the March 2024 correction and the current market correction and the current correction phase supply of stable coins is trending upwards so what's that mean well it means the current market is in a state where it is ready to rise quickly whenever strong catalysts emerge right and that's clear because although Bitcoin price is trending down the stable coins on all exchanges is trending up we saw something similar like this back in 2024 they circled this i would really circle right here stable coin liquidity remains strong and then that brings us to the question then who's selling well it's not Black Rockck it's not institutions they're actually still aggressively accumulating since January of 2024 ETFs public companies and El Salvador bought almost a million Bitcoin everyone else since January 2024 sold 657,000 Bitcoin meaning OGs are selling institutions are buying this is what Bitcoin distribution looks like and something like this does make sense bitcoin whales OGs that bought Bitcoin when this space was unregulated way back in the day they probably bought for $100 maybe $1,000 BTC when the Bitcoin price crossed $100,000 per coin that was a big psychological level and they could see the new money the public companies the regulated entities whales getting in so they took profit the crypto OGs are selling to the institutions and that is so so clear with visuals like this public companies with Bitcoin holdings 2 years ago just 33 public companies held Bitcoin on their balance sheet today over 80 public companies are now buying Bitcoin corporate FOMO is heating up and I asked the same question two years ago but do we think this number today 80 public companies is shrinking or is it growing long-term and that brings us to five crypto coins under $1 that are still implementing in 2025 and I addressed this in detail about three months ago five crypto investing mistakes you must avoid with real examples but biggest mistake valuing crypto coins on their price versus their market cap that's what noobs do do not value crypto coins by their price meaning coins under a dollar means nothing market cap is how pros evaluate coins for a more in-depth analysis I encourage you to check out this video market cap versus price so valuable but now understanding that price is just sort of an arbitrary but fun but engaging metric to group together different coins coin number five sitting under a dollar is Cardano coming in at 69 cardano is currently outpacing Visa prominent financial giant Visa cardano's faster with Hydra's 15.5 billion transactions in a day of course this is with Hydra which is sort of a layer 2 a partner chain the Hydra protocol is a layer 2 scaling solution designed to enhance Cardano's transaction throughput significantly and the news today is this cardano processed over 15.5 billion transactions and this comes right from the product manager of input output one of the main developers of the Cardano blockchain and on December 3rd lo and behold we managed to get to 1 million TPS and even passed it a little bit and after that period you know it was uh it was really fun cuz all of this happened during the constitutional convention you know everyone was working on the constitution there were you know tensions were high governance you know a lot of really exciting things happening at the same time and in the midst of this we had the Hydrodoom tournament we got to this big milestone you know I I I uh had made a a really cool uh transaction visualizer that I saw some people were like literally streaming this thing where you can just like see all of the transactions across all of the different hydroheads that we used it was just like a an avalanche of uh of transactions and after just like 24 hours of that we had processed 15 and a half billion transactions in 24 hours so it it was really crazy so growth milestones like this tells me that the Cardano blockchain is prepping themselves for the big leagues for mass adoption next coin on today's list that is clearly implementing during the Bitcoin crash and is currently under $1 is Algrand at about 18 and many of you still aren't aware of who's building on Algrand they are partnered with Europe's second largest electricity producer Engel Group here is a recent 45se secondond clip of CEO of the Algarand Foundation breaking down how Engle Group is using the Algrand blockchain you know a very interesting uh uh project we have going on in Italy with ENL it's the second um it's the second biggest utility in the world tokenizing solar credits right so it's the kind of the same thing why don't why can't you get and this this is only enabled again in web 3 why can't you avail yourself of solar credits right what if you live in Ireland where it rains all the time what if you live in an apartment building and you're on the fourth floor and you don't have access to the roof you can buy an an Enel solar panel and that solar panel can be off in the field somewhere where it's sunny all the time and where Enel gets huge economies of scale because it's better to build a lot of solar panels together in one field than it is to put them on like one solar panel on one roof all over and so you know maybe the market for trading solar credits is not going to be that liquid but it's still critical to have that tokenization because Enel you can sell back to Enel if you don't use you know all all of your energy you can sell back to Enel you can it's tokenized so it's just very it's a very efficient way to do things and what this means if you hold Algrand is that the energy industry's future isn't coming it's already being built on Algrand by the way if you're looking for a great exchange to buy

still implementing coming in at less than a penny is Supra so Super is a layer one smart contract platform we do need gas like ETH and Ether and E on Ethereum you can need gas to transact similarly you use Supra to transact but what's interesting about what we have to offer is that Supra also has these other services we have price sheets we're servicing all these other uh mainets right now layer ones and layer 2 onchain randomness to power games and the news today is this as Supra's layer 1 grows vertically our Oracle services are expanding in all directions meaning projects are collaborating with Supra projects are using them our oracle price feeds and DVRF which is verifiable randomness function services are firing on all emerging ecosystems most recently they have three different blockchains including including bar chain so cool to see more and more projects on boarding onto Supra another really interesting thing that's happening is world mobile is collabing with giggle academy for those who don't know Giggle Academy is CZ the exfounder and ex CEO of Binance this is his new venture can you define it for somebody who's never heard of it what is Gig Giggle Academy yeah so it's basically a educational platform that's delivered digitally for uh people who don't have access to education and while Giggle Academy has nothing to do with crypto they're collaborating with World Mobile we're here in Kenya today at Faith Junior Academy with a local community ISP to install a super low latency satellite internet service to provide Wi-Fi to the students and staff here with World Mobile Air nodes tablets and giggle academy they now have access to the internet and digital education and by hosting an air node the school earns revenue helping sustain its mission this is about a 40-second clip watch how our deepen sharing economy empowers communities this school is a key part of the sharing economy model that we've created the school becomes the air node host they're the installer of the satellite backhole they're also providing a mesh network to further away properties so that they can sell home and business internet all of these commercial opportunities will bring revenue into the school which makes their operations much more sustainable long-term than having to be dependent on charitable [Music] donations you know one of the parts of this project that we're doing we've provided a whole load of tablets for the children and teachers to use in which they will be utilizing the Giggle Academy app so even though the Bitcoin price is down so cool to see the innovation happening in crypto and very quickly next coin on today's list coming in at under a dollar iso currently about 82 cents and the news today if you're in Washington DC you've seen this american markets global access ando is unlocking access to US financial markets for everybody our billboards in DC highlight the vital role of tokenization ahead of key policy discussions meaning this was specifically put in place around DC in preparation for the SEC's crypto task force roundtables in the DC blockchain summit which happened congress people and regular people from all over saw this and while this is an ongoing story click subscribe to altcoin daily because the minute any of these projects get an update I will make a video i will keep you updated and comment down below which altcoin I missed like all we see tomorrow"
