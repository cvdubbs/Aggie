    "transcript": " the Trump mem coin wasn't just a success it was a monster a meteoric rise that drained billions in liquidity leaving once thriving crypto markets gasping for air while it Skyrocket to success it left a trail of Destruction crashing entire sectors of the crypto Market but remember every crash breeds opportunity this is how it's always been historically right now everything looks dead I know you're feeling it our old coin bags are wrecked smart money is quietly positioning in sectors set to explode next in this video I'll show you where we can find the biggest gains that are hiding and how you can ride the rebound to massive profits guys if that sounds good to you do me a favor destroy that like button if you're new to the channel subscribe if you're here watching the video subscribe hit the Bell notification hit all so you can get these videos because they are times sensitive we bring you Alpha Monday through 5 in this channel guys what's up my name is Kyle Shas happy to be here with you guys for this historic time in the markets something that is completely totally changing our lives AI crypto it's unbelievable without further Ado guys let's get into it look like the BTC chart and of course the salon along I told you guys about right now is just about Break Even so it retraced at least I'm not down right now I do think that we probably aren't going to go much lower right now I don't know we we could I'm leaving the trade open right now my Bitcoin trade is still open I think these things have are going to go much higher I think people are a little disappointed because in the first wave of executive orders and we'll talk about those today we didn't see the Bitcoin Reserve executive order is that going to be a bill is it going to be an executive order we don't know yet I don't think he's done with them we'll go over some of those executive orders in just a second here he also didn't commute Ross but Elon said it's coming we'll go over that as well so yesterday the markets were closed that's so we're not going to cover ETF data but we did hit an all-time high yesterday people anticipating potentially the Strategic Bitcoin reserve and Bitcoin topped out $109,000 35798 guys and now I was watching it last night the inauguration President Trump the pro Bitcoin president is now our president these are the executive orders that were signed in last night and I believe there's a bunch more coming here in the next couple days because we had rumor that there's maybe 200 of them this looks like there's maybe 30 of them really really interesting very America First personality here of course getting rid of wokeism saying there's only two genders male and female latching down on the southern border putting tariffs on Canada and Mexico labeling the cartels as terrorists I'm going to go after terrorists really heavy they're going to be doing uh Mass deportations this week I've already seen pictures of you know just Caravans of illegal immigrants fleeting for the southern border you know like it or or or not that's what's happening I also saw some posts of some crypto companies saying they were going to go to look to headquarters himself in the United States which I think is a little bit premature considering we don't even know what the regulation is going to be like yet but you know we do know what he has said before that he wants to make America the crypto capital of the world which is probably you know why you might want to be there to be able to ride that Capital injection of American money that's going to be coming into the space over the next decade or so is going to be mind-blowing so solid Intel says you know strategic Bitcoin Reserve not listed as an immediate priority in the documents sent Republican lawmakers by the Trump Administration we shall see but the odds of the Bitcoin Reserve being issued on poly markets in the first 100 days drops to 30% now there's not a huge amount of people guys betting on this one there's only $3 million in volume which means this isn't a very good representation but it is people betting money and uh you know this was pretty accurate on the outcome of the election however there was like 300 million or something like that in volume versus this 3 million right now Leo trades over here says Biden's inauguration was a massive selloff 20% it marked the best entry possible for the 21 Giga if history repeats this will be the the final chance to buy before Valhalla as Elio said so history doesn't repeat but it Rhymes so could this be the best time to be buying alts you guys know from the previous videos I've told you I have been buying some alts that I think are going to bounce the strongest and we'll talk about that more today as well so even though even though we didn't get something immediately from the pardon or the commute of Ross alri Elon comes out to remind us that Ross will be freed as well there was the j6 the January 6 Trump calls them hostages they were the people who 1500 people who got arrested for January 6th last night got pardoned and will be out of jail a lot of them got 5year sentences so they'll be out at least a year early which is fantastic for them you can see this is really cool from coin Telegraph they blogger layer G mapped connections between Donald Trump's new Administration and crypto projects so just some really interesting connections here you've got in the White House you got David saaks who's a cryptar and this is his VC craft Ventures invested in dydx and I guess David invested in ZRX as well I don't know as an angel maybe and this s Christan Krishan senior policy adviser for he also works a16z then you've got Doge of course Elon Musk and Howard lutnick who uh is part of tether and then you know of course Elon with Doge and Doge both the original Doge and the new Doge that we've talked about on the channel before many times at the inauguration party and the ball you sawu Ando Solana and some of the projects that were highlighted was a trump token world Liberty fi Ando Ena link Su and a cftc will now be probably more involved in regulating crypto you got Marco santerini who is a chair candidates of F cfdc and Brian quintes a16z and Marco uh is part of Kraken as well Eric Trump you know holds bitcoinu I guess eth n Soul Scott bassent treasury secretary holding Bitcoin Pete heus Secretary of Defense holding Bitcoin of course Trump and this Trump token World Liberty fi over here holding link Tron a Ando Anda the new SEC chairman Paul Atkins is an adviser for reserve rsr securitize and Ando and I think that's a really interesting so good bet is that these tokens are all going to be pumping over the next year uh make a note if you want blue chips that are probably worth putting some money into at the time of the inauguration to commemorate the 47th president World Liberty fi bought 47 million of eth $47 million of wrapped Bitcoin because in on eth which is where the D5 protocol is you can't buy Bitcoin directly so they bought wrapped Bitcoin I thought it was interesting that they bought wbtc versus coinbase wtdc but it is what it is they bought $4.7 million of a $4.7 million of Link $4.7 million of Tron which is really interesting because Tron is not on the ethereum blockchain so I don't know why they wouldn't bought Bitcoin spots either and then 4.7 millions of OFA and I know World Liberty is actually looking to acquire more projects as well I just got hit up about that about an hour ago so uh we'll keep you updated on those as well but it's one of them that I was advising and we launched on PID Network as well last Bull Run Trump's World Liberty Financial bought 47 million of wrapped Bitcoin at the inauguration commemorating that 47th president and then sine research but a really good post here saying crypto Twitter is unstable I don't know if you guys live on crypto Twitter or not if you do follow me at Kyle Shas but seeing people debating if the cycle is topped because Trump rugged Us by not immediately ordering the US to Mar to Market bu billions of BTC meanwhile his family so that's the kind of argument right now why everyone's freaking out right but meanwhile his family launched two meme coins this weekend Market bought nine figures of crypto today that was the world Liberty has has has multiple nft projects and instated a crypto zar and O and we also have a crypto-friendly cftc and SEC now you're not bullish enough Byzantine General says I think that Trump kickstarted a full-blown alt season I expect profits from Trump to flow into other alts we're seeing that already mainly onchain stuff Salon ecosystem coins will profit most specifically memes I think but the trickle down effect might be Market wide to be honest now in the past week we've only seen two sectors that have not Fallen uh negative which have been layer ones and defi right layer ones and defi so so we'll get into those in a bit but salana tvl has surpassed 10 billion for the first time since the FTX debacle and as we know from the show yesterday salana just been crushing all kinds of Records the deck trading volume surpassed 158 billion which is shattering B&B chains 140 billion all-time records set in May 2021 the highest ever for any blockchain super crazy so salana actually won big time now keep an eye on this right this is really like we have to look at post very suspect right because at first this look like wow 83% chance or if we go here closer 90% chance almost Salon ETF approved in 2025 but there's only $30,000 of volume on here not even 30,000 so I would Market this as a good judge as we know from the show we made last week uh you know Jeff or James safe art from uh from from Bloomberg intelligence thinks that there's a higher chance of xrp ETF getting approved this year than salana due to the unclarity of the ongoing SEC lawsuit with salana currently we'll see we shall see but you see salana took a big hit also was down a lot as well not very good but everything else took quite a big hit over the past 24 hours a little bit of green right now but still over the past 24 hours things got hit really really hard just some more High Level news just so you guys understand what's going on right now in the past 3 months 22% of ethereum's outflows went into s right 61% into salana salana is still dominant alt layer one other than ethereum obviously getting most of the attention right now s getting the second most followed by arbitrum butu is you know almost four times more than arbitrum for example and salana three times more thanu for example so those are the only two that really actually matter in fact if we look base not getting too much at all 2.32% so really looking at the S ecosystem that's why you guys know I talk about that quite a bit and this post isn't super relevant because the volume I think is so low but it does show you what nanson tracks as smart money where it's flowing Bon had the biggest inflows followed by this [\u00a0__\u00a0] of $781,000 unicorn fart dust by 400,000 USA coin by 300,000 chill guy 237 and so on and so forth as you see over here now so [\u00a0__\u00a0] had this crazy runup like almost super cabal style I think everyone took profits and we'll see if the community still exists over there but it does seem like a crazy potentially you know potentially crazy crazy potential here now I'm not saying I'm buying but I am bringing it to your awareness in case it's something that you guys were looking for looking to get into potentially you can see it had this crazy pullback of 83% and currently sitting here at a 78% pullback which pretty damn good right so I think it would be interesting to look at let's go look at actually metrics right now on this one all right as you can see the metrics for [\u00a0__\u00a0] right now you know not huge inflows but you know inflows nonetheless I mean in the past day you've had 633 633 people new people coming in and as you can see over for the Trump coin as well in the past day there's been almost 60,000 people selling completely their bags and exiting the trumpcoin you know we had almost 900,000 holders before 692 th000 holders right now just to show you the State of Affairs people exiting and taking profits out of trump rolling into other things Trump was listed in Robin Hood and as you can see it's having a bit of recovery right now it came all the way down to 6 billion market cap up at 7.86 billion right now that is Trump and uh Jose Maria MTO over here made a pretty good post my read is that the Insiders who helped launch Trump didn't realize how much it would pump and either didn't buy enough or sold too early so they rushed to run it back with Melania and make sure they filled their bags this time very visible in the chart in their greed they nuked $30 billion of value transformed Optics into pure grift and probably committed a bunch of crimes too I also think that it was totally unnecessary for them to launch Melania like who follows Mia anyway I don't know maybe people do but like certainly not nearly as famous As Trump but famous nonetheless and it's a free market so people can do whatever they want and a lot of people are speculating there's going to be other members of the Trump family launching meme coins I don't know if they will I hope they don't but people made a chart over here in case you are curious is it going to be Baron you know people think Baron or is it going to be Donald Trump Jr or Eric Trump Trump or Ivanka or nobody I don't know but be careful out there there was this morning someone had bought a Twitter account that was made in 2013 changed the username to Baron Trump like Baron W Trump or something like that made people believe that it was actually his account it was verified but not government verified but verified just like normal blue check mark and then made a post saying hello salana and then 30 minutes later posted a contract address had crazy volume the thing rugged in like 10 minutes guy changed a profile and was out so careful out there just know it's uh you should always check try to make sure things are legitimate before aping in but I know temp temptation is hard sometimes you know waiting an a half an hour to do due diligence on Trump could have you know cost you 100% gains or whatever so I don't know but searches for AI agents have hockey sticked defi Fai is being built to keep the promises that defi made AI agents built on truly decentralized stack across comput and orchestration application execution layers are coming okay Nick Garcia made a pretty good post of here we got a peak yesterday of where Trump liquidity is going to going to flow crypto and AI Arc which we talked about in the show last week is now clear number two open source framework by GitHub metrics and number three framework by market cap at over 500 million it was the fastest horse on rotation out of trump and survived the binance per curse it was listed on binance per recent Partnerships with arbitrum abstract mongod DB Soul graph Etc to underscore legitimacy of what the developer is cooking there are still multiple new Partnerships and projects launches to be announced in the near future expect continue upside from Arc we've talked about it before you have a nice pullback happening right now on Arc as the entire markets are selling off remember we talked about this too last week on the show I don't remember exactly when we mentioned it but you can see right now there's almost a 30% pullback so if you think that's interesting I think it's interesting it's not as popular yet as ai6 Z but it's picking up a lot of attention and there's a lot of room for competition sitting currently at a $382 million market cap I think this thing still has another 10x in it for sure to go um I don't know how long it'll take to to see that but you know I think that it it will probably pull a similar run to a6z I think a6z has a big correction right now and you know it can come back I think ai6 Z you know maybe tops out this bull market at 50 billion or something like that maybe this Arc still too early because we don't know yet the quality of what's going to come out of Arc so it could be nothing it could be something interesting by the popularity of the GitHub it does tell me that there's like good things happening over there so you know that could be an interesting play it's one of the top ones in the AI infrastructure stack as you can see over here at coin gecko top AI framework coins by market cap AI 16z right now sitting at a$1 billion FTV and Arc this AI rig complex sitting at less than that let's refresh 300 you just saw 3 381 391 something like that AI rig Arc 384 I don't know too much about this frasa one but I heard it was quite interesting I haven't really checked it out yet so those are the ones I'm really looking at I mean there's other ones too I talked about in the show yesterday if you haven't seen yesterday show go check it out cuz I mentioned a few others over there that are interesting lower cap more degenerate that more potential upside and also a sector to keep your eye on is the top AI agent Launchpad coins by market cap of course uh virtuals which we are very bullish on and griffan I think is one of the most interesting uh technologically speaking it's really really impressive what they're doing with uh Defi and these kind of things and so I still think that like you know having good positions in ai6 Z Griffin Arc Maybe virtuals but the base protocol and the interface is a little bit difficult on virtuals but still that's where a lot of the best agents have come out of this protocol over here so keep your eye over there as well guys all right guys that's going to wrap it up for today this is a pullback as Elio said before if it rhymes like last bull run this could be the biggest buying opportunity ever before a meteoric rise of 2025 personally I think that's what what's going to happen not Financial advice do your own research I'll catch you guys tomorrow see you later"
