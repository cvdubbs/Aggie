    "transcript": " president Donald Trump has just initiated the starting Bell for what will be an historic Bull Run and a lot of people are wondering well is this for real was this a crazy cash grab is he serious about supporting crypto and why price not go up right now I'm going to tell you exactly what I mean by Donald Trump effectively firing the shot that will be considered the beginning of the bull run because that's how I see what just happened and you need to understand the psychology of a bull run to really understand why this is so big even if at this very second the prices aren't explosively upwards I'm going to tell you why not only has nothing changed here but things might be even more bullish I guess shortterm uh especially shortterm than I had thought so I'm going to take a second here hop in the chat bullish guys I don't know what to say this is going to be insane uh we have Trump who just launched a coin everyone missed it almost everyone is now thinking what's next and I wanted to go over this tweet I'm just going to I'm going to go back to this cuz this is fundamentally one of my most important points here which is uh an entire cycle starts when people Miss stuff you can think back at 2021 Bitcoin alltime highs Dogecoin explosive uh meme coins making people Filthy Rich and everyone's showing up going what's next these are the types of events that create massive massive excitement and they bring new traders in they bring new money in they bring new blood in and so this is what's happening right now I'm not going to go over I I made a much more dramatic version of this a few minutes ago I don't know if you guys heard it um and then at the same time people are saying okay well this kind of looks like a Distributive right you have anom here saying you know this looks like distribution to me effectively and I don't know if this is true obviously the Y cofs they they do kind of hold right so this might distribute a bit but what we see here is the real question we we're wondering is is this the beginning of a presidency where the actual most important person in the world as far as policy the president of the United States is going to put crypto first and we know the answer to that is yes Trump literally just launched his own cryptocoin and that coin reached a a fully diluted value of almost $80 billion of which 80% is essentially his right so you can I know there's a lot of debate as to whether Trump's a real billionaire or not I have no opinion on that but my opinion is this whether or not he was a billionaire I don't think there's any uh calculation that had his wealth stretching into the DECA billions specifically not Beyond 50 60 70 billion no way okay no way so if that's true you know his his raw fdv value of his coins obviously that would never translate exactly to cash but his raw net worth in those moments when the coin was trading at 75 bucks was over $60 billion which is crazy and so does he care does he care about crypto absolutely obviously we'll talk about the absolute show that took took place throughout the rest of the week um last few days but the main thing is this which is that every cycle we get some new um updates here and in this one we have moonshot now which you guys have used moonshot it's effectively a mobile app where you can buy crypto you can buy meme coins right from your PayPal it's very very easy you can just do it right on your mobile um very easy to get money in you don't need to go to an exchange kyc move salana onchain set up wallets not it's just an app boom and now you're trading meme coins this is kind of like the Robin Hood of meme coins that's the and it shot up to the number one finance app and the number four app in the world oh did people take notice of this did people want to participate in this absolutely and this brought in an incredibly big new crop of buyers so we have a few uh key components here one is that people missed and that's actually huge and two people wanted to come in they explo they explosively jumped into crypto and then three we have Trump himself on his Project's balance sheet buying and you can see this I tweeted it you have Trump buying 47 million of Bit Coin and 47 million of eth to celebrate his inauguration as the 47th president right so this is this is just massive I don't know how else you could think of this there's no other framing ex except that this is insanely big um and if you think that Trump is they there's two questions do you think Trump cares about crypto is not the right question people looked at the Trump crypto launch and said does he only care about making money or does he care about crypto and despite what if your answer is he cares about crypto boom great bullish if your answer is he only cares about making money well he just bought almost a 100 million of Bitcoin and E so if you think he's acting in a self-interest then right now that is crypto so there's no real other path uh to whether or not this is bullish to answer that question then in my opinion it resolves to a yes whether you like One path or the other so a lot of people have really strong opinions about this as well and one of the opinions that I thought was important to to put out here was this uh a lot of people have an idea of what crypto should be and they because we spend so much time here in this industry you impose your own personal judgment framework on crypto but at the same time we get really mad when people want to restrict crypto people from doing what they want to do so there's kind of a two-pronged aspect of this which is you cannot impose your own ethical framework on what crypto should be if you really believe that crypto should be unbridled you know to do whatever it wants to do if you think crypto is this adoption rail that should be essentially opened up and let to go free then there will be versions of crypto that you disagree with completely and so in a world where crypto is totally allowed to prosper just like on the internet there's stuff that you're going to be a fan of and stuff that you're not going to be a fan of and I think that having the if you have a limitation in your head of that everything in crypto needs to match my own personal framework and you're really going to one have a have a bad day have a bad time because people not everyone's the same there is guaranteed going to be things that you disagree with that happen there's things that I disagree with that happen but the question is not really what you like or what you don't like but it's what is best for the industry and what's best for the industry is letting Builders build things happen and you applying your own ethical framework to it do that with your own self right but you getting mad that crypto is not going to grow because something happened somewhere that you disagree with is I think it's it's going to hold you back personally I think it's going to hold you back and when I ditched my own hatred towards meme coins hatred towards non-utility projects or whatever I started performing incredibly uh way better right last cycle it really was the nft side the board Apes I was like okay well something feels real here I bought those and it really helped me understand no I've been looking at this the wrong lens if you remember back in that day I was really really against meme coins really really against anything without hardcore onchain utility anyway I think the question uh that you guys should all be wondering is not should it be but what is it what is crypto and crypto is essentially free Capital formation across the world anyone can choose to raise Capital around an asset for anything that they choose obviously within as long as it's legal um and so that is what it is and people will buy assets if they think they go up and so that is a very simple way to view it the market only sees buys and sells right the market does not see your emotion so I would say that that's one thing I want to implore on people as they look at things like Trump and the and and the coin um moving on we also had the dxy the the Dixie just broke down here and I haven't checked the chart again this morning maybe it bounced but this is an indication that people just genuinely think that the dollar will be weakened because of Scott bassent right so that is the treasury secretary he's going to be making key decisions as to whether or not the dollar is going to be strengthened whether or not we're going to spend more all of those things uh are going to effectively be decided by The Dixie and and this is where the Whispers of how strong the dollar is going to be start coming through obviously not a perfect metric right it's not just like Dixie Down Bitcoin up but in general if the dxy goes down there's less confidence in the dollar more people want to put things in other places uh we also I mean I'll just say this there's a lot of fear as to whether or not inflation will destroy Bitcoin or uh the the economy and the macro prints will destroy Bitcoin and we saw during the last sort of hiccupy phase before we broke 100K again everyone was focusing on non-farm payrolls and macro data that they just haven't looked at for a long time because Drome Powell said okay well we're not so sure if we're going to do another rate cut and that my friends I I think you should really compartmentalize the macro stuff because we went through the macro uh cycle where it completely crushed the industry in 2021 and 2022 and then macro and all those signals and all those beats started being very inconsequential and I believe that they've mostly worn off where essentially the general optimism is more stimulus more support for markets and a looser monetary condition and this is sort of how you start seeing that be expressed but in general here's one caveat if we get some Screaming absolutely screaming High inflation print like way outside of the expectation way above what we think might happen that is one example where I think we you could look to see okay make maybe crypto will react because the FED will have to dramatically change their plan the difference between two rate cuts and three rate Cuts is nothing it's just nothing so that's not going to affect what we're doing here the difference between zero rate Cuts or maybe even rate tightening and five rate Cuts that's huge right that's those are Worlds Apart um but you have to understand the actual Desire by the current Administration is to weaken this that's the worldview of Scott bassent who's the treasury secretary and we can imagine that Trump will exer exert some kind of influence over the uh over the over the FED obviously Jerome Powell has been sort of digging his heels in but that's the only thing here so dxy I expect to generally Trend lower over the next few years I respect for the FED to generally be adding more and more support over the next few years uh unless there's some Screaming crazy high inflation print so that's where I'd say don't get too caught up in macro right um and another very important news Zuck is Zuck is ready to risk it all okay this is really smash like if you uh if you support Zuck risking it all okay um I don't I think it's horrible I think it's horrible what he's doing here I personally I will never use uh Instagram again actually um okay uh in a world where we get a crypto Zar right we have a crypto Zar uh David Sachs obviously if you know anything about this guy David Sachs you'll know that he invested as one of the first checks into multicoin Capital which was one of the first like essentially the biggest funer of salana so if you're wondering how some of these dots connect obviously this is super bullish to have salana and one of the main blockchains where essentially all of this sort of really crazy Innovation some of the more hectic Innovation is going on as well as some of the more risky behaviors is going on well we can assume here that after this weekend those are no longer going to be nearly as risky and that you're going to see a lot more people kind of approach this the way they might have launch with launching an app back in the 201s you know a lot of people that I know like big business people they're not going to launch cryptocoins because they're scared you know that's the reality uh people who have positions of real power with huge amounts of funding maybe they're very successful they don't they don't want to have their life ruined I it's just sort of the more risk-prone young people who are like you know what I don't care I'm going to do this because this is my shot but that gray Market is ending and now it's a an an open market right it's it's not a black market or a gray Market this is now the the above board the what is it a bright Market a light Market whatever it is and this is how I feel regarding the trumpcoin which I think is the most important news here which is that most people don't get it crypto changed forever this was obviously a day or so ago we're entering into a period the likes of which have never been seen SE anything goes bigger than the 2017 Ico bubble I don't care if you're happy about it or not it's happening adapt now and this is the truth which is that a lot of people have this ethical concern for what happened without looking at the actual reality the president launched a mem coin within seconds it was at tens of billions of dollars within a day it was at almost hundred billion dollar Capital formed around it a lot of people made money and what it says is that anything is going to happen now there are all of the Frameworks around the way things have to be framed are kind of gone and some people say oh this is going to lead to a lot of negative outcomes that's true it's going to lead to a lot of positive outcomes too it's going to lead to a lot more outcomes and that's where you have to understand that the concept of decentralization is fundamentally built on the idea that not everything's going to work of course just like the internet not every website is good we is a good website not every uh app is a good app but there is an Amazon there's a Facebook there are there's a Google there's a magnificent 7 there's a massive wave of innovation and prosperity coming from this industry in its best sense and there's a massive amount of opportunity for anyone who wants to build anything coming right even if you're just a person who has a following or whatever you can form Capital around yourself and what we see here is that anything is going to happen here and most likely most likely people who take advantage of these early days are going to do really well I can't I can't see it any other way all of the short-term noise is exactly that and uh and there's a lot of people again calling oh this is the top president launched a coin there's no one left who else comes after the president and I think that that's one way to say okay I hope there's no bigger meme coin than the President coming I don't think that's good maybe Elon I don't think Elon launching a coin I I don't know if it's good or not I'd have to think about it but again the the question isn't who's going to launch the next big meme coin it's what happens next and if the smartest most uh Innovative and wealthiest people in the world all pour into this industry as a result of a big green flag being waved then I think it's good I think it's massively positive so that's my that's my basic take here um we also have here that uh total 3 is making a breakout and the last time it did this was February 2021 so what can I say that was pretty much the biggest bull month the biggest explosion of value in crypto history was February 2021 I I I want to see the percentage on it but it's insane uh as far as psycho here he has a good take he's saying still think yesterday's sudden pump was Insider lead that the price action mimicked the ETF approval front running I'm long here with tight stops big policy news is coming soon in my opinion let's find out again I'm not sitting here live streaming all day uh I had to whip up this I had a lot of Team meetings had to do this live stream and then I'm going to hit the gym I'll come back and hopefully we see some Mega announcements uh but if not I don't think that today is the end of that's not the end of the story and in fact if you think about what happened here and you just understand think about the worst version in your head you might have of Trump's greed that is all the reason now that lines up with I think that there's going to be some massive announcements not just for Bitcoin and eth but for altcoins for for crypto in general I think uh he's going to lay the absolute gas on the fire because looking at what um Anthony Pomano said this guy measures his success by the stock price and by bitcoin price he said it in so many speeches a prices went up you see I'm great so by that you know he's going to want to do the things that are going to continue that narrative okay he knows that's how people see the world he's a business guy so with that said let's dive into the craziness and talk about essentially what happened the last few days I said wait WTF is happening um I got all these notifications I was watching a movie on the couch with my wife and I realized that people were linking me to this post and uh I didn't realize it was happening so quickly uh but essentially I went on and I just tweeted what's happening because I really didn't know and uh I thought this was a hack I was just trying to see what people are saying you know obviously a lot of people saying this is an onchain Massacre um people are saying this is insane saying no one knows you can see there's just so much confusion here in fact a lot of people were calling it um a full scam and uh like you can see hacked hacked hacked uh really a lot of people were not were not of the belief that this was a real launch and so these first few minutes were extremely extremely chaotic um but over time you know I was digging through private chats through everything and and everyone was just trying to compile the every piece of data that they could to figure out is is this real or is this not and after a few minutes it was pretty clear that it hadn't been pulled down and my thought process was really simple it's I don't want to miss this if this is real I'm not going to miss it um personally my my uh mindset and I think this might surprise some people is when World Liberty fi his onchain project was announced I actually thought that was a misstep and I almost reached out to the family um because they do follow me and I almost said why not just a memec coin you know because that's the attention economy is where he thrives building crypto stuff we don't know in fact you know a bit dubious right and so I was very much so in the mentality of expecting this Trump mcoin for a while and kind of thinking it would do better than a defi project but that said I was expecting it because I've been looking at the the crypto markets for so long looking at the the sort of political landscape and it just made sense to me and so when this happened I was already mentally prepared for this is this would be a move that makes sense to me um so maybe that's part of why some people reacted and were like oh instantly in and other people you know they thought there's no way this is real so that's part of why I was able to react pretty quickly but regardless um you know what there was a lot of debate here um essentially I I stated publicly this was around two to three bucks I said um you know I'm going to sweep some coins in here uh where is this yeah I mean I was pretty much just posting like stream of Consciousness so if you're not following me on X please follow me on X there was no time to make a video like that I wasn't going to go live stream like this I'm just sort of posting things as I see them and anyway I was just joking like can Trump hop on Spaces um it's either the onchain I was like compiling evidence that if this was real because we had Phantom verification the LLC was identified uh 80% of Supply withheld which is crazy but then again it actually matched up with who we think of Donald Trump as a person of course he would take 80% so these are the types of things that I was doing in real time so follow me on X anyway the point is all the emotion kind of process through and I started to realize you know what this is this could actually be a bigger than than I thought of course then we got um where is this I I believe that essentially this benefited people who were really locked in you know I don't want to preach a an unhealthy work work life balance but this is no sleep season in my view right because there's so much happening every few minutes that you need to be completely locked in you can't you can't look at this next year and say okay I'm just going to work for a couple hours a day like you very well might be extremely late because within a few hours this was trading in the 20 to $30 range so um that's the difference is something like this which to me seemed like at least a high percentage chance to make money you would miss if you were late so this is where I think you know essentially the president has fired once again the starting gun here which is there's now been such a big missed opportunity that everyone recalibrates the way they look at the market um again I'm not making a price prediction as to where Trump goes next I'm just telling you how I see this right now in this moment okay now as a result of this salon did some insane insane work lifting 12.3 billion in Dex volume more than all other chains combined and more than any chain has ever done in one day it onboarded all these people incredibly well uh of course until the Melania coin which we'll talk about here but salana really was an absolute shining star on the tech side validated everything uh that we want to think about salana and it showed okay if you're going to launch something big it has to go on salana and a lot of eth people were struggling with this they thought well eth is the serious chain salana is the is the jokey chain for meme coins and crime and whatever the jokes are but now people are starting to look at this differently they're saying well okay actually maybe salana is the serious chain and as someone obviously you guys know that I have been pushing salana as the the coin the chain of the cycle since about $13 publicly here on the channel that's that's just how I've seen it since the lows which is the community is Hardcore and the tech is great works way faster better cheaper than ethereum and it's only gotten exponentially more interesting over the course of the cycle so this was this was a big green flag so all of the next big launches you can expect them to happen on salana that's just the reality um I do think base has a lot of good stuff coming um certainly I'm focused my team is focused on building cool cool stuff on Bas um being that gaming and a lot of the AI stuff is very ethereum native um but salana is showing that they are essentially the key player here so everything I said about rot in all my profits to salana salana is essentially like the one simple stupid Long play of the cycle this kind of confirmed a lot of that now other people are saying okay this is the top for salana it can only go down from here there's nothing bigger I would just say this kind of feels to me like the beginning of what you saw with the nft onboarding onto eth in 2021 um I think uh yeah my buddy Frank actually brought this up to me and he was like dude that what we saw in 2021 is going to happen and salana in 2025 and I think that that's a similar mindset I think it could be a similar framework that we see just retail onboard directly to salana through things like moonshot and other types of very simple onboarding mechanisms that's possible and I think that it's also possible we see people onboard directly to Bas those are the two chains that are clearly the the consumer winners right now and they have the tooling to make it easy for people to go from zero like zero to trading on chain and that's what people want to do um there was also a lot of very suspicious buys here um I I'll talk about that in a second but yeah I mean I was I was laughing pretty much all weekend because this is exactly what we said would happen for the last three years we said we were going to come show up in 2025 things were going to get absolutely insane and that we would win bigger than we've ever won and the super cycle is effectively about what's about to happen since then since we started talking about the super cycle uh we had the first crypto President we have the end of the war of tyranny on crypto we have LW changing we have a potential for a Bitcoin strategic Reserve we have interest rates in possession to be cut we have pretty much every bullish Catalyst known Dem man shaping up behind us and it just feels really gratifying right and I I put this out a few minutes ago which is my framework for 25 is Bitcoin God candles AI Omega bubble mcoin super cycle play to earn gaming uh Giga season rate cut Mega pump deregulation Sonic Boom super cycle now I can put the cash tag goodbye Gary goodbye Gary let's push let's put the cash tag up um but very quickly after this whole thing took off we started seeing uh you know my buddy virtual bacon if you guys know Dennis he doesn't he's not like super moon boyish with anything he's very grounded in his expectations but he even tweeted $300 to flip Doge um and that becomes sort of the next Target if you're looking at targets for the Trump coin it's like okay well what's above it now is a meme the only thing left is Dogecoin and so um and because we're not talking fdv we're talking about circulating which is only 20% of the tokens um and so this is the mindset if you're bullish on Trump and I'm not saying that you have to be but if you are this is the mindset that people are taking to it which is in the high $200 range or so is what what it would take to flip Doge um and obviously I jokingly said you know uh Doge isn't funny to me at all you know in in the end Trump is a meme and that's what I think people need to really wrap their heads around which is how big is the meme if you think meme coins are valued by the size of the meme then the question is how big is the meme and how big is how big is the pool of virs and not just in the United States which there's 70 million or so people who voted for Trump but globally how many people know Trump or associate Trump with something some feeling some emotion I think I think the number is extremely high um again I'm not telling people to buy this I hold a bunch of it I made that clear uh but I could lose all my money here who knows because quite frankly um this is how this is how the weekend went it did not go how I thought it would go uh we have anom posting here we've been trading the attention economy for five years now and you think that a token uh and you think there's a token that can get more attention than the leader of the free world's mem coin this is one of those mid curve left curve right curve like a left curve person who just like oh Trump meme coin by the right curve person is thinking more like this and the mid- curve person is like no it's just a grift he can't do this this and that 80% Supply locked and I think that that's what kind of separated people who bought and didn't buy was people who kind of overthought it which is of course Trump is a meme he's a living breathing meme that's just what it it's what it is if there's anyone who's more translatable to a mem coin and I've been thinking about that for over a year now which is why doesn't he just launch a meme coin I don't know if you remember he had all those financial troubles he was getting sued he had all these legal issues legal battles the campaign Finance in my head I was like launch a mcoin but then we got this this was this was so bad all right all right hold on so so we have here we have here like what is potentially the best setup sorry this is where it gets like clownishly bad um so we have Trump and he's trading it's literally up here the coin is about to go up here and make a new high over $75 potentially hit a hundred billion dollar fdv in the first like two days right and then we get hit with uh where is this hold on hold on where's where's the Melania then we with this and I'm laughing I'm laughing through the pain a little bit because this obviously as someone who had swept a lot of my uh my onchain poop coins into Trump um where you know I this isn't good this wasn't good because I don't want to hold Melania I don't think Melania is a meme so like my in my brain I'm like who would want to hold Melania respectfully the first lady that is not an interesting coin to me I don't know anyone who really wants to hold Melania I don't associate Melania with anything really personally again other people might be different but this was like this was horrible right because now it calls into question how serious uh Trump is about his own project you're like okay well does he care at all about this Trump meme or is he just going to Nuke this thing right off the bat because launching this Melania coin two days later calls into question everything all the bull case for Trump sort of um so the only thought process that I have here that is sort of a Saving Grace which is why I actually um even added a little bit of trump coin on this dip because it it essentially did this this is what happened to the charts as soon as that was announced we got essentially this um complete new on the charts right we got this ex destructive downside from 75 bucks all the way down um and so uh and these are my hopium higher low lines right I don't know if we're going to hold them but uh as soon as that happened this the Trump coin lost what was this from 30 bucks 27 bucks just call it 50 billion in fdv almost from top to bottom of which they own 80% of right so that is $40 billion in raw value that that Trump held in his wallet just from announcing the Milani coin and so a lot of people are like what are they going to do a coin for literally everyone now that's the fear is that there's more coins okay well we thought everyone was just going to pile into the Trump coin now they're going to do a coin for everybody that's pretty scary well it just invalidates the thesis right and so after thinking about a little bit there's essentially something called the emoluments Clause there's a there's a rule that the president's not supposed to profit from his presidency obviously I don't know if he's going to strictly adhere that but the thought is that he tried to get these out right before he took office and right after Gary left the SEC so right right as Gary left and sort of officially couldn't sue him for this and right before he takes office he did it this weekend and he had to do both that's like the only thought process that has me still holding my trump here um because I do believe that if he was serious about this Trump coin and this this project and he didn't essentially just try to Nuke it this could be bigger than Doge that's sort of my mental framework is that it is a bigger meme than Doge everyone knows Trump all around the world and Associates him with success or I mean depending on how you associate him he's got a a wide perceived sort of association with success wealth power whatever so I think the meme is is strong if he doesn't launch any more family coins I don't know what to say stop launching family coins this is crazy um but anyway so that's what caused this and I was thinking the whole way up man I wish ID bought more and if there was a big dip I'll buy some and there was a big dip so I bought some and I stuck to it again trying to remove my emotions as to all that other fud but I think that fud was why a lot of this you know chart has more or less collapsed so with all that being said don't copy trade me I have no idea if this is going to be good or bad I'm just sharing with you my thoughts in real time as I had them uh something I tried to do less of because it can be so scrutinized by the public people hate when big accounts share uh share anything really but when I was talking about Trump in these in these early moments down here around two bucks a lot were calling me a scammer a lot of people were you know I'm going to get everyone wrecked blah blah blah blah and um and I think everyone just has a has a big opinion as to what account like myself can and can't share but I mean this to me the leader of the Free World launching a meme coin significant right this is this is crazy also significant um there was a ton of suspicious trades and Insider activity now is this Trump I don't know um but the reality is that we know that this was one of the biggest launches ever there were a ton of other groups whether it was Jupiter um exchanges moonshot there were all these apps that quickly verified it so there was obviously some communication meaning it wasn't just Trump's Camp it wasn't just his team that knew about this other people knew and some people capitalized that's for sure um I didn't know I found out with you guys um and I just acted quickly so that's the thing is preparation opportunity those are the two that have to meet for you to find something like this and buy quickly um and that's why it takes a few Cycles before you actually have funds ready or sitting always on the computer um but there will be more right and this is kind of the summary right which is it's baffling that they had a coin go to $80 billion uh which they owned 80% of and knew the launch date uh so they could buy infinite at launch time and even after all that we're greedy enough to launch a second coin on the second day absolutely insane this is the mind-numbing part but as mind- numbing as it really appears it brings me back to if someone's going to act with this much greed or perceived greed then they're going to continue to act in their best interest which is this has multiplied Trump's net worth by a by an unconscionable margin in an unthinkable amount of time so everything that here what whatever conclusion this data leads you to still brings me back to but they'll probably want the coin to keep going up right like that's just kind of where I'm at so I'm caught again uh do do your own research here but this is why I think that this is still not a crazy thing happening and it's maybe a little more Nuance than it seems uh we have uh little just to break this up we have the the founder of Rumble Chris have uh palowski yeah he just bought Bitcoin with the rumble treasury again we're going to start seeing a lot more companies starting adding Bitcoin I think that there the people who are in the know and this guy is very close to the trumps uh people know that something's coming and I wouldn't be shocked to see some kind of major Bitcoin bills being passed here I don't think I don't think the crypto anxiety around will they do anything for us is valid I think that they will do stuff um a lot of Founders here uh like the akos founder again agreement an agreement I thought this tweet was hilarious uh a coin whale just bought $135,000 of trump he said imagine trying to explain this to someone in 2025 in 2005 and again shout out shout out to Trump let's make this the super cycle that's all I can say here is the the middle curve here is to be like can't believe this happened I'm shocked I have all this emotional sort of baggage around this the left curve and the right curve way to think about this is quite simply the president has greenl this industry literally because if anything negative happens it's happening to him now it's happening to his wallet it's happening to his uh legal status it's happening to his safety it is all about him now and if you think that he's concerned with himself then it's good for crypto because he's now Associated himself at the hip with crypto okay um again quick timeline of events here Trump launches beam coin hooray countless new Traders massive liquidity back black hole PVE environment new Traders coming in and so solidifies technical exceptionalism milania launches meme coin entire societal collapse um literally salana the blockchain completely collapsed it was it was hilarious I actually couldn't believe it like it was actually insane so um what what a world like just what an age we're in I I just can't believe it I just can't believe it but all roads lead back to this being insanely bullish again oh yeah a lot of people want me to talk about tokenomics here very valid very valid tokenomics here are the coins start unlocking in about 3 months three months from two days ago or whatever in by that point I'm planning to be out of this trade or mostly out of this trade because there's a high likelihood they're going to sell a lot of it so I don't know whether it goes to zero but certainly a lot of people are going to be anticipating that unlock that starts in three months so tokenomics are terrible but as long as they don't violate those tokenomics as long as they don't sell it before the tokenomics unlock I believe that a couple of months here as long as enough to see this play out I'll update you guys if and when I sell other stuff uh or if and when I sell Trump I'll I will let you guys know um for now this is sort of my main framework is I'm GNA ride it to see if they can get past this Melania hiccup the market then gains confidence that they're not going to launch an Eric token and a Don Junior token and a baron token and a this send that as long as they don't do all that that they uh sell some tokens from the treasury early that would completely send this thing to zero uh or Elon La um we already went over that already went over that already went over that okay so altcoins here's the altcoins that I think are going to benefit most in the short term I think that we're going to see two types of altcoins benefit right the first Co the first type is the made in America altcoin um and there's now even on coin gecko there's these uh there's a made in America tab let me see if I can find it here uh and this is kind of helpful where is this this up okay so on coin and this is let me go let me go dark mode salana usdc chain link avax we actually brought all these up uh very recently um I don't oh man I don't know if that video went out my editor is on vacation so uh that's why the output's been a little low we've been doing some live streams here to fill in so smash the like button if you appreciate me uh going out doing livees it's been a while I'm Rusty I'm Rusty on it so if you like this video a lot I'll do more um and I'll hop into the chat at the end of the video so I don't have the chat up right now I'm trying to focus on Focus okay okay uh this of the made in America again this is mostly just speculation because we don't know what the actual qualifications are going to be for made in America list but the key obvious ones are xrp soul chain link AFX um besides xrp you know I hold the other ones um not as much link but I mean link is actually amazing Tech that just pretty much has just become boring since 2019 since that big run uh but Litecoin harar some people think harar is going to get the First new ETF I don't know how valuable that's going to be because the ETF thought process was like okay these are going to be the only ones allowed um and it hasn't even done that much for ethereum clearly so whether or not this sends these to the Moon I don't know obviously salana ETF is the big one that's gonna that's going to be impactful algorand you have Ando the rwa obviously trumpcoin and the thought is why have this why have this list well if he's serious uh okay you can still see it here it's cut off a little if you serious well there will be no taxation on on these particular coins and that is going to be one of the biggest Force multipliers you could ever imagine for money coming into crypto imagine you no longer have to pay taxes on your gains it's going to rewire the invest the modern investor is going to flock to crypto and then everything else is going to leave the stock the traditional archaic model and jump into crypto this is going to be all financial markets just like we've always predicted it but it's it's going to happen quicker than you think if they end up making it so there's no taxes on American cryptos whatever that means okay hyper liid again this is more like the hot ball of money uh thing right um so wherever the hot ball of money was uh which a lot of it was on hyper liquid it went all the way up to uh 34 bucks here it's now coming down a bit again it could come down lower if this you know if this indigestion here on bitcoin continues we could get even lower on hyper liquid oh wait hold on I should go back to this view um hyper liquid right this is a big one you have the AI coins right the uh where is this you have obviously Trump we have um where is salana is going to be huge we just talked about that the virtuals project right so this is kind of like the king of AI projects right now and again AI agents are still going to be the big Tech breakthrough from outside that you get to speculate on now in crypto there's going to be a lot of AI agent sort of noise and excitement and um and this is going to define the next era so whenever this indigestion ends something like virtuals will probably catch that hot ball of money again because it hasn't been replaced yet as as the exciting project so I'm expecting for the AI agent stuff which are getting absolutely pummeled right now to do very well once once the market starts trending again so these dips I think for things like virtuals which are kind of the effective leaders and King makers in their spaces um and the AI ai6 Z's um like look at this this is down from 230 down to 88 um I think that these types projects will do well again that's that's my general thought process and I'd be looking to add here as we get lower and then uh where is it obviously fcoin has been an incredible performer as we mentioned if this thing starts coming down it hits the AI it hits the meme it hits the nothing matters sort of nihilism it hits the funny it hits the mid bottom left up every side of the curve again fcoin is is is a unique coin and and farts are funny um but those are like the kind of coins these AI hype coins now when I go through my genuine uh framework for this particular cycle and I'll explain each each uh bullet point here I didn't just say this because it sounds good even though I think it does sound good but uh the Bitcoin God candles right I think that we're going to see some massive Bitcoin God candles around one just liquidity Cycles the FED is going to ease interest rate Cuts we're going to see potential Bitcoin strategic Reserve we're going to see all kinds of beneficial things for Bitcoin and you're going to see again the corporate strategy Playbook of companies adding Bitcoin like the global hunger for Bitcoin is going to reach a fever pitch and it's going to be it's it's bullish for Bitcoin probably significantly higher because gold would have bit the gold market cap is a good comp for Bitcoin and uh I think gold uh if we if Bitcoin tied gold or matched gold in market cap it's like 700k per coin um I'm not saying it's going to happen this cycle but I think we're bullish up towards that Target okay AI Omega bubble this is happening right now the biggest caveat I'll say and why I think AI is going to reach the peak of you know inflated expectations kind of like we saw with metaverse in 2021 the inflated expectations are because ai's real Innovation triggers are happening outside of crypto the speculation triggers and the way to take what's happening outside of crypto and make it uh something you can bet on and make money from or the way AI companies can now raise money in crypto and sort of fund their new ideas that's happening and that's very interesting but the real Innovation is not happening currently as as much inside crypto as it is happening at anthropic and open Ai and those big giants uh Google Etc so the difference is unlike defi or unlike metaverse right which were not really external developments to crypto those were internal things oh you can have you know tokens that you let you own stuff in digital worlds you can have uh defi borrowing and lending that's permissionless on TR on chain those things were Native Innovations to crypto that were not available outside so the Innovation trigger nfts those were all Native Innovations to crypto that were not happening outside whereas AI there are some value there is some value to decentralizing AI very much so I think the dpin stuff the decentralized physical infrastructure that's clear um there's demand side product side uh there's supply side product uh fit but there's not demand side product Market fit yet so we'll see if people want to buy it that way but there's certainly a way to deliver it that way way um and then finally um when we look at the other uh parts of this list um the play to earn Giga season so this is where you start to see gaming which is what I'm excited about which is now in the slope of Enlightenment where we're going to start to see people actually deliver wins where play to earn is going to start becoming more sustainable with a bull market you're going to start seeing Play to earn tokens be able to sustain higher reward rate reward rates and my fundamental belief is that play to earn in the new gaming season uh we'll see us return kind of back to play to earn uh sorry uh the new gaming season will go back kind of to play to earn and I think that's going to surprise people because they think oh we've moved past axi but no I think the iterative growth on the next version of axi will be tremendous I think it's going to suck in a lot of players meme coins obviously have not gone anywhere going back to the whole point of this video or the whole concept behind this video mcoin super cycle happening a AI Omega bubble happening I do think that this bursts in a very nasty way um but a lot of bubbles burst in nasty ways I mean everything bursts in a nasty way um so these three I mean again AI meme coins and play to earn or gaming you guys know that I have been extremely extremely bullish on these three categories since the bottom obviously some have performed really well some have performed less excitingly um obviously super has outperformed its category by many orders of magnitude um but the reality is that I'm very very bullish on what's coming or the next the next wave of gaming so again I'm long on that go check out actually I have an interview here with Vance Spencer um and this video where I talked about this interview didn't come out yet um where is this uh here no here uh where where is this here um Vance is the uh director or the uh partner at 1200 partner at framework um and it's one of the biggest funds in the entire space and he absolutely crushed it he was like seed investor at chain link and all of defi they have crushed much every era in crypto and he pretty much was saying that he's much more bullish on gaming because of the Moes that gaming has I'd encourage you please go uh take a peek watch this I still haven't done the giveaway here for this $11,000 in Soul so go watch that and um because I threw a lot of my soul in my hot wallets into um into Trump you might win $ thousand dollar in Trump if you want that um but he talks about how he's more bullish here on gaming uh than the decentralized AI and I found that interesting because right now everyone's just talking about Ai and even people in the comments on my content ai ai ai it's not don't don't talk about gaming Alo it's not interesting so I found this very very educational and I think you guys should have a have a look at this have a look at it right um and so those are the bullet points that I think are most important um which is you know play to earn is going to happen I believe with with a more bullish wealth effect in the market you're going have the memec coin super cycle clearly Trump has shown meme coins Not Dead uh the big ones are have potential to really have dramatic impacts not just on the market but on culture uh you have the AI Omega bubble where I think you just get this these unconscionable valuations for everything AI um but I also don't think it sustains because the real Innovation triggers are outside the industry you have the Bitcoin God candles and then you get rate cuts and deregulation and these are just going to add tremendous amounts of fire on top of what we have here so that's my general mental framework uh that's why I think what we saw with Trump was very bullish around the mem coin launch even if you particularly didn't like that he did this you think that he shouldn't do this I think that when you logic through uh all of the sort of surrounding pieces of data it's pretty hard to to call it bearish and then uh what else do we got here I think that's about it um that's all I have for you for today uh if you guys enjoyed this video make sure oh oh wait no I have one more thing I have one more thing for you which is if you guys are looking to build some incredible incredible karma for the bull run this is how you do it um some of my dear family friends have lost everything elderly couple uh they were living in Malibu for 50 years uh living on trailers and sort of uh semi-permanent
