    "transcript": " crypto coin the other day do you intend to continue selling products that benefit yourself personally while you're president well I don't know if it benefited I don't know how where it is I don't know much about it other than I launched it I heard it was very successful I haven't checked it where is it today Bitcoin holders are mad today did you expect by the way an executive order of some sort yesterday do not be fooled there is much more going on than meets the eye hit the like button make sure you watch today's whole video unbelievable that after Donald Trump's day one in office he failed to deliver on a promise that would have been relatively easy for him commute the sentence of Bitcoin OG Silk Road founder Ross alri and if you vote for me on day one I will commute the sentence of Ross alrick to a sentence of time sered commuting Ross's sentence would have sent a positive message to the crypto Community showing that Trump is serious about doing what he promised if I am elected it will be the policy of my Administration United States of America to keep 100% of all the Bitcoin the US government currently holds or acquires into the future we'll keep 100% I hope you do well please this will serve in effect as the core of the Strategic National Bitcoin stockpile now despite Trump's failure on this multiple inside sources including Bitcoin Inc founder David bile and even Elon Musk confirming it will happen soon just not on day one I guess today's video is brought to you by silent Swap this is my go-to platform to send Swap and Bridge my crypto in private with ease at the lowest cost 100% non-custodial and safe with silent swap there is no traceable connection between wallets I'll link my full tutorial video in the description use my affiliate link for 10% off all platform fees despite all of this industry leaders like coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong are still very excited and looking forward to the positive changes that he says will come with a trump presidency it's been one day um I'm not too worried what is the executive order that you're looking for well I think the first one would be just directing the agencies of the US government to collaborate and work toward getting some clear rules passed that's what would really allow Capital to flow into the United States and for startups to be built there I think just rearticulating some of these Bill of Rights if you will that people have the right to self custodial wall and the right to own Bitcoin without being persecuted or being debanked that was a big issue in the past four years as well operation show Point 2.0 so-called so those are some of the things I think that could be done with executive orders but it's really going to take Congress and legislation because look at this even in the interim before Trump's SEC chair appointment proc crypto Paul Atkins gets confirmed Trump has appointed Pro crypto Mark UDA to serve as acting SEC chair in the interim this is a clip from when Gary Gensler was still acting chair well it's great to be here what is the secc doing regarding crypto well our policies and our approach the last several years have been just really a disaster for the whole industry we have been setting this policy through enforcement we've done nothing to provide guidance on it and as a result this has been shaped by the courts and different courts have ruled different ways what has gone on is part of a broader frustration with the fact that we have not provided interpretive guidance as to what you can and cannot do and if you are involved in some sort of Securities offering how you register how you get regulated as a broker dealer how you get registered as an exchange plus Brian Armstrong is actively supporting a Bitcoin strategic Reserve now here he is teaching other world leaders at Davos at the world economic Forum why a Bitcoin strategic Reserve is good now say that okay Bitcoins okay what about Platinum what about Cod why not we hold strategic beef reserves or muton reserves or apple Reserves why Bitcoin so so so so it's a public policy issue that we have got to be engaged in and I would caution against the move then that would say there is an industry with a particular interest in a particular product and we would like to impose it on society and say Society must hold this as a reserve I would have a fundamental problem with it so why why Bitcoin reserve and not beef reserves and mutton reserves anyone wants to comment on that I think that um you know if you like Neil Ferguson is here he has a great book on the ascent of money and he's a historian and so many things have been used as money over the years um I think it's pretty you know this is still maybe a new idea um but I think it's clear at this point that you know Bitcoin is a better form of money than gold it is provably scarce just like gold but it's more portable and divisible um so you can actually use it has higher utility I would say and it was the best performing asset of the last 10 years and so for store of value I think it's going to be important for governments to hold this over time it may not it might start with being 1% of their reserves but I think over time it'll it'll come to be equal to or greater than gold reserves okay great so yes we're still expecting big things to happen for crypto this year with Trump Brian Armstrong says get ready for a massive 2025 there seems to be a full-on c change or at least it seems that way in Washington about your world yeah I mean it's really the dawn of a new day for crypto and the energ was just palpable throughout the room you have to remember I mean the last four years we really felt like we were being attacked by this Administration and they tried to weaponize the lack of clarity in the rules to really push back even on the good actors right there were some bad actors too to be fair but they even really tried to go after the good actors I think like us so the industry is just ready for this new change they're ready for Clear rules and that's our big push next is try to go get some legislation passed in the US to make it even more clear to understand how different things are this year compared to any any other time in crypto's history you have to understand how things used to be because of people like Elizabeth Warren things used to be really bad for crypto this has changed about the choke point 2.0 because there's been a lot of debate about it do you genuinely believe that people were being quote unquote debanked because they owned crypto at all or that they were being debanked because they were seen at those Banks as a risk of some sort to the bank I think what happened is that The Regulators likely juled by people like Elizabeth Warren uh they started to apply a soft pressure to the banks and they said we're just we have concerns about crypto you know vague statements like that like risk-based statements and you know if you're a bank CEO that's a really hard thing to do if your regulator tells you to come in comes in and says hey we're uncomfortable with this and you know you say well is it illegal and they're say no we're just uncomfortable with it I mean you know it's really hard for them to stand up to their regulator and so that kind of soft pressure which was really unlawful in my view uh was what was happening so we're seeing Trump's crypto companies buy crypto by the boatloads buying millions of dollars in Bitcoin ethereum link a Tron Ena staking 15 million plus worth of ethereum trump and Melania both launching their own meme coins coinbase just listing Trump today you you made a lot of money sir how much several billion dollars it seems like in the last several days several billion that's peanuts for these guys what do you you think about all this Brian Armstrong says he's excited by the participation of the Trump family in crypto and he thinks memecoins are the start of something big what is your feeling about the Trump family's involvement in crypto and specifically the idea obviously that uh president Trump put out a meme coin that was at some point worth you know tens of billions of dollars Melania doing the same uh there are some people even inside crypto that I've seen who are very critical of those decisions uh because they look like an enrichment of the president well the thing about meme coins is you have to remember a lot of Technology Innovation things start off looking like a toy right think about the early internet you know and people were putting silly animated gifts and like photos of cats and things and it turned out to be much more important than that right and so you always have to be a little cautious like with meme coins it's not something I'm personally like trading all the time I I'm not particularly interested in it but it could evolve into something very powerful and so you always have to kind of keep an open mind about these things and the family part um I you know like I said I think anybody should be able to go and do this I I don't have too much of an opinion on that so how high do you think Bitcoin climbs in 2025 we're well over 100k right now but everybody seems bearish this is good Brian Armstrong thinks bitcoin's price hits multi-millions because of everything he's seeing do you agree with this I think over time we'll see Bitcoin get into the millions multiple Millions price range I mean it's being adopted by more and more institutional customers um the ETFs brought in a huge amount of inflow if we get clear legislation passed in the US that would be a big milestone strategic Bitcoin Reserve if the US took that path probably the rest of the G20 would follow in fact you know I've discussed with a number of Finance ministers here in Switzerland um from different countries around the world just the idea of a strategic Bitcoin Reserve they're getting more interested in it now because the US is looking into it so I think Bitcoin has a long way to go it's going to be the new gold standard out there and crypto is really much bigger than that too it's it's about payments it's about economic freedom and many things else if you're interested in making money in crypto subscribe to our Channel turn notifications on also follow us on Twitter it takes me hours to
