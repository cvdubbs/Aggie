    "transcript": " the Fed just ended quantitative tightening so is it time to jump in with both feet and start buying up our beloved coins is it time to reverse course and become a full bullard once again is it time to get out of this funk and go full risk on well of course we're going to get to the bottom of that question right now and look at exactly what the Federal Reserve did because like it or not what we've seen throughout the last few months in crypto the extreme bearish sentiment has been the result of a liquidity crunch that has affected assets across the world not just here in crypto so let's get in and read exactly what the Fed is doing because the details of this matter a lot and understanding exactly what's happening looking at some historic examples understanding every aspect of what's happening with Trump's economic plan we can make ourselves a little guide here as to what we're going to do with our beloved assets first and foremost this is no tulip we know that crypto is going to make a raging comeback the question is when and exactly what is the best way to play our stack obviously if tulips had a hash rate like this I wouldn't fade them look at Bitcoin up only on the hash rate and there were some absolutely seismic bounces happening in altcoins and of course Bitcoin no longer perfectly adhering to my blue line which was originally black but this was the line I had drawn obviously just scribbling saying \"Okay I think Bitcoin might play out like this.\" As you can see we've seen it bounce nicely upwards here importantly today we broke past this about 85k resistance that we had been trying to get over and the question is is it full bull mode is the market extremely bullish based on what Jerome Powell has said here is it time to flip into a bull and start buying the dip aggressively obviously we're in the nibble zone here for a few minutes is it enough did we do what need to be done did we do the needful well the truth is right now we're starting to see some pretty massive capitulation just yesterday Kyouong Ju who has been extremely bullish this entire cycle they said \"Look it's over expecting 6 to 12 months of bearish/sideways price action.\" He's saying all the metrics on chain are signaling a bare market fresh liquidity drying up new whales are selling Bitcoin at lower prices and Cryptocoin users who subscribe to his alerts he issued this signal a few days ago he's been calling for a bull market even when the indicators were borderline and now he's saying he's sorry he changes his view now and it's pretty clear that we're entering a bare market scott Besson is saying that the market drop is a healthy correction but he finally admits finally that a recession is possible we haven't seen the rword come out of Besson's mouth but of course one of the reasons why I flipped around and I started to look at this situation differently is that the rhetoric coming out of the Trump admin was no longer you're going to win so much you're sick of winning and it was \"Hold on wait temporary pain there's got to be a period of adjustment in 6 to 12 months we'll get Trump's economy not yet you we still are in Biden's economy.\" And all of those words were leading me to believe that they are not seeing a very bullish resolution not immediately at least not this month not this typical seasonality that we see the year after the having in our beloved crypto coins remember we're in a period of transition this is from the White House bessant is saying in clip after clip that we've been addicted to government spending for far too long and now it's time to relever the private sector we actually dug into what this means and his exact plan to relevate sector we're going to talk about that a little bit now so we understand what is the goal what is the goal of all of this pain transition what are we working towards because we need to understand what the goal is to understand how to play this with our personal assets so first and foremost this is a very interesting clip i'm not going to play it all for you here but the gist of this is that Scott Besson wants to reprivatize the economy and the way he sees that is he wants to get interest rates lower and then he wants to have local banks commercial banks not necessarily Bank of America but you know the smaller banks he wants them to lend out to businesses with much less regulation so remember there's all this regulation that came in after the great financial crisis really restricting how banks could lend money and that's because they got over their skis they started being really degen with the way they were lending money and so there was all these new rules put on banks well those rules are effectively holding back individuals from starting businesses from getting access to cheap capital to effectively grow the economy and Scott Besson is saying look instead of spending so much on the government through the government we want to get interest rates lower and then let the banks lend and create new capital in the world that's effectively the plan we know with cheap interest rates will come the ability to have access to money houses will become cheaper everything will become cheaper and what we usually see with cheap interest rates is people take on more risk because it's easy to get cheap money it's easy to put that into something that's going to work for you there's also no reason to leave your money in cash because it's not doing anything in cash right now your money is earning 5% in cash so low interest rates drives money into business it typically grows the economy but how are we going to get there this is why we need to understand what's going on with the Federal Reserve this is the one thing that's been keeping me awake at night because if you're in Trump's position and you've made a lot of promises mostly to workingclass everyday Americans saying \"We're going to fix the price of goods and services we're going to fix the price of home affordability we're going to make it so Americans are rich have a lot of opportunity here we're going to bring manufacturing back onshore to America.\" All of these are very bluecollar promises saying \"Hey look we're going to make life better for the middle class of America.\" However if you're being completely honest the way to make things better for working-class America is to screw over the investor class right now the investor class is the ones who have derived all of the value of the economy all of the value is going to those owning stocks the people owning assets houses they've made all this money based on inflation based on money printing based effectively on the government getting involved with the economy and intervening all of that intervention has led to asset owners getting filthy rich while normal people struggle so the easiest way to sort of write the table is to kind of screw over asset holders to dump the markets and to drive all of the productive value into effectively wage earners and the way you would do that the way you would really do that is taking away what we call the Fed put okay this is a concept that we talk about a lot which is that there's effectively a put that most investors believe is in the market people call it a Fed put uh or a Treasury put but the point is this if markets go down severely you can effectively expect the White House or the Federal Reserve effectively the government to start buying stuff that no one else is buying like stocks real estate whatever the asset is that is toxic they will find a sinkhole of money to use and if they don't have it they will print it this is the mechanism where people go look if it gets too bad they're going to step in right that's what we keep saying if something breaks the Fed will step in the government will step in because they're not just going to let the modern American economic wonder machine just go to zero right because eventually if things start really breaking banks go under people lose their life savings they show up at the bank it's not there right the bank no longer has their money and that would call into question everyone's belief in this American capitalist system so what's been keeping me awake at night is that there's a concept here that maybe maybe there will not be a Fed put under Trump that Trump will just pull that away and say \"You know what these investors have gotten saved time and time again and the people paying the bill for that is the American working class the middle class that this is effectively the way that he's going to write the deck.\" Because if you're a workingclass American you probably don't care that much about stock prices you probably don't care that much about the cost of Bitcoin or the price of Bitcoin you don't care that much about these elaborate money games going on that you don't have access to you do care about what you're getting paid and what you can get with that money you care about the value of your dollar and you care about the cost of your living and the quality of your living if the quality of living on your salary goes up you're happy if the stock price of Nvidia goes up you probably don't care or if it goes down a lot you probably don't care so what kept me awake at night over the last few weeks is trying to wonder is the Fed put still there is Trump and the Fed actually going to save markets if they do break something because it certainly feels like this tariff dance this global trade war the goal is not only to bring stuff and manufacturing back into the United States but it's also to walk down markets it's to get the price of things down it's to crash the markets so they can kill inflation bring rates down and then stimulate and have more sustainable growth without inflation this seems pretty obvious at this point but it only really works as an investing strategy if there is a put there if we know that at a certain point the government the Fed they will step in and obviously lowering interest rates is the first step to that and then after that you have quantitative easing where the government will actually start buying stuff now actually I have an answer to that i have a theory which is that not only is the Fed put still there but they actually want to bring assets onto the balance sheet and give exposure to those assets to the American people where instead of just saying \"Okay American people you have access to treasury bills or you have access to some services,\" they actually want to start effectively investing in assets on behalf of the American people that is what it really sounds like when I start to listen through and try to find my way through all of the rhetoric coming out of the White House it's not that they don't believe in assets long term it's that they're trying to reconfigure the deck so that the average American actually has some exposure to those assets and this is really game-changing because it gives you a very clear map on effectively the intentions of this administration remember intentions are one thing and outcomes are different but the intentions and I believe that this administration has a coherent plan as to how they want to do this the intentions are not to abandon the investor class listen to this he's going to be the first president in generations who is going to he wants to create assets for the American people not just debt so he wants to take the debt down and then this idea of assets there was a lot of talk about this economic deal we're going to do with Ukraine that would have gone in the sovereign wealth fund right the other day when the sovereign wealth fund was announced President Trump surprised me in the oval and said \"Could you make a few remarks?\" And I said \"Well we're we're going to we're going to mo we're going to mobilize the asset side of the balance sheet.\" And all the gold bugs said he's going to re he's going to revalue the gold i I can say today we're not revaluing the gold but what we are going to do is Doug Bergam at Interior every other department head is looking for the assets that we can mobilize so look if if we have energy leases federal government owns back to the housing shortage federal government owns a lot of land in downtown urban areas can we use that land yeah do you see a wave of privatizations as a way to sort of both pay down the deficits and debts and also just to That's important to me like why put in a sovereign wealth fund versus pay down the debt help help kind of do the finance math for us oh you think you get a higher return right so listen exactly to what Scott Besson said which is pretty much that he believes in giving Americans exposure to assets and that he believes they can do better with the asset side of things than simply paying down the debt the debt is worth 4% and change right in cash however the asset side of it he believes is going to be worth vastly more and that's why they're going to put things into a sovereign wealth fund versus just get rid of the debt he thinks they're going to get way more asset growth out of that and that the American people will effectively own those assets so decode this a little bit yes they need to kill inflation yes they do need to get interest rates lower so that banks can start lending and that's how they're reprivatizing the whole economy but are they going to abandon the investor class no they're not in fact they are going to make the government become the investor class that is actually the polar opposite of what I was worrying about and that means that the Fed put that the government put effectively is not only there but it's going to take on even new meaning in my opinion and while this could actually in its new form benefit everyday Americans even more so right you have better jobs better salaries less inflation you have all these things happening locally but on the other hand the government is getting wise and starting to play the asset game on behalf of the American people that's what I'm hearing from this interview but let's just hear him explain it just a little bit more i want you to hear it directly from his lips on one uh we are trying to bring down this massive federal debt cut the spending and but in a controlled way so of course they don't want to cause a recession that's what I'm hearing here of their three-part plan of course they want to control the deficit and cut spending we know that we have to do that but usually the danger there is that it could cause a recession it's austerity it's effectively not stimulative it's the opposite so that's the worry is that they're going to make things worse but that's part one they need to control the spending and the deficit because that's creating the inflation that's ruining the middle class i don't like to repeat private conversations with the president but I'll repeat this one because I think it's very the it really illustrates where his head was at first time I went to see into seam saw him at Mara Largo and walk in the door he said \"Scott how are we going to get these debt and deficits down without causing a recession?\" Boom there we get it so we hear that the intention is not to cause a recession that he's trying to get the debt and deficit down without the recession the question is can they and what I worry about with the no recession thing which I think is still on the table is do they have time do they have time to slow walk these things because politics it's a four-year cycle they have midterms in two years do they have time to wait for all of these things which could take several years to actually turn around we'll talk about that in just a few minutes but I want you to see the final part here that's exactly where we are now how are we going to get the debt and deficits down not close a recession and I said \"Sir um when you win you didn't get us here we're going to set a goal by 2028 we want to get back to the long-term average we're going to deflate it slowly.\" And long-term average being about 3% deficit to GDP about three three and a half% deficit to GDP and you know like I keep saying the US we don't have a revenue problem we have a spending problem because we are averaging right about 18% revenue and I'm talking about federal government federal government only we're at about 18% and Biden administration blew it out blew the spending out to 25 normally it's about 21 A2 anyway that's it i just wanted to show you the three pieces of this plan they want to lower the deficit hopefully not cause a recession they want to reprivatize get rates lower get banks lending and if you listen they really aren't going to cut taxes all that much that's the final part is that don't expect that many taxes to be cut because the issue is that the government has a spending problem if they cut their income then they'll have even bigger of a spending problem so it's about the gap between what they spend and what they make that's what causes the deficit so Bessant knows this he's not dumb he knows you can't cut all of your income and expect to reduce your deficit you're just creating this huge gap those are the key points and what you need to know from this is that interest rates coming down inflation coming down those are the key metrics that are going to allow Trump to do everything that he wants to do that's the absolute key for Bessant for Trump for all their plans is to get interest rates down now today we finally got what I can consider a massive update from the FOMC this is the big meeting where once every month sometimes two months or 3 months we get an update on what they're going to do what Jerome Pow and the Fed is going to do with interest rates this is the big one and we finally heard that QT is ending this is quantitative tightening is actually ending as my buddy Dennis here says finally a positive Fed balance sheet update from FOMC beginning in April the committee will slow the pace of decline slow the pace of decline of its securities holdings by reducing the monthly redemption cap on treasury securities from 25 billion to 5 billion so this is huge you have effectively an 80% reduction here in the amount of selling that they're going to do but mind you they're not stopping selling and this brings up the question you know that Ben Cowan has here which is they couldn't have just made it zero they couldn't have just stopped QT it's just kind of frustrating right because this is still months away and they're slowing QT but they're not stopping QT so we don't even have a full pause on QT what I do find is actually interesting is that they will not be and you can see here they will not actually be slowing down the pace of their mortgage back securities sales right their mortgage back securities if you see on the line down here the committee will maintain the monthly redemption cap on agency debt and agency mortgage back securities at 35 billion meaning they're going to keep selling this and in fact it might seem that they're going to keep selling this until they're they're done holding mortgage back securities so again this isn't quite the full pause to QT this isn't just a line in the sand saying \"Look we're going to stop reducing our balance sheet.\" They're still reducing their balance sheet and actually even though they're going to start selling $20 billion less per month of securities meaning stocks and stuff they are still doing a significant clip an unchanged clip in mortgage back securities and to me this reads like they're still trying to crack housing they still want housing to come down significantly because they believe that housing's too expensive and if they keep selling those mortgage back securities in theory it'll keep putting pressure on the housing market so now that we understand pretty clearly Trump's goals they want to bring down interest rates well we can also look and we also understand the Fed's goals they want to bring down inflation and what I thought was quite interesting is it seemed to me like Trump and Powell were actually at odds with each other they were fighting in public you know Trump was saying \"Oh bring down interest rates.\" And Drone Powell was punching back saying \"You don't own this space i own this space this is me dog.\" So it kind of felt like they were beefing but then I talked with some macro analysts and I took a little step back and I realized no they are actually for the first time on the same side because the Trump administration's goals and the Fed are both the same if they're slow walking the economy and trying to get the economy to slow down that's what causes inflation to slow down even though there's debate over tariffs being actually inflationary we'll show you in a little bit that effectively Jerome Powell doesn't see it that way and so it's important to remember that the Biden administration and Janet Yellen were stimulating the economy they were drawing down the TGA they were emptying out the strategic petroleum reserve they were doing everything they could to buoy the economy which actually worked against what Jerome Powell and the Fed were doing the Jerome Pal and the Fed were trying to slow things down and they were trying to keep things up so this is the first time where it actually seems like Jerome Powell and Trump are bickering but they're actually aligned much more than the Biden administration we haven't seen the executive branch and the Fed actually doing the same things at the same time and unfortunately those things are not great for our bags short term so we finally see alignment here we know that effectively Bessant and Trump want to get interest rates down that's technically what the Fed wants to do as well but they just need inflation to for sure come down before they do that or else they risk you know as you know spiraling prices you know civil unrest we know the deal inflation's bad bad bad not good so it's important here that the Fed's Jerome Powell said later in the press conference the base case is that the inflation the tariff inflation specifically will be transitory which of course set off some alarm bells for all of us who remember the inflation is transitory comments back in 2022 uh well what we know now is that you know Jerome Powell is saying that he doesn't believe that this tariff stuff is actually going to cause permanent inflation it caused a small uptick in inflation that they believe people frontloaded goods for but they're not seeing this being consistent over time inflation from tariffs so this is a good sign i mean it's showing once again that what Trump is doing is actually in line with what Powell is doing what I find funny here and you see the KI here says actually Jerome Powell says there's only a probability of recession about 1 to 4% probability uh we don't make such a forecast that there's going to be a recession but of course the betting markets have a 38% chance of recession i think that when you weigh the reality of Trump slowly turning a big ship and getting results maybe in 3 years or 5 years out of his plans today and weighing the opportunity to have something really bad really quick and then move into a much better period of prosperity those two options seem pretty obvious that the politically expedient option is more pain frontloaded so if I were to guess I would say that just based on gut based on if I were in Trump's shoes I think that I would want a quick and dirty recession because that would solve all my problems and allow me to move into this new era of America but of course predicting recessions is a very difficult task who knows a lot of people have failed at it but that's just me that's my gut feel and I'm not saying that there's a guaranteed recession i'm just saying it seems to accomplish the goals faster more efficiently and it allows for Trump to have more years in office doing the stuff he wants to do as opposed to hoping that inflation comes down slowly as the Giver says Jerome Powell said \"F the surveys.\" That's the CT equivalent of saying it's alt season essentially the surveys were saying \"Oh inflation's coming back you got to worry about it.\" And Jerome Powell says \"Nah dog not worried about those surveys like I don't really care about the surveys and the consumer sentiment.\" What I do want to say here is that the Fed did say that they see some stagflation here you see inflation being higher than they wanted for longer and then you also see some weakness in the economy so you see some stagnation and inflation and this opens the door for looser conditions and duration risk anyway in short the press conference came across quite dovish but it was still a mixed stance so with all that being said we now need to look at the data and assume here that we're getting an almost pause on quantitative tightening and that that's coming in April and what could that mean and we're going to simulate this as if it were a full pause in quantitative tightening and analyze it against the days of yestery year and see how when they stopped quantitative tightening what happened and try to understand what we can do to position obviously some folks like Ivan were saying this was the most bullish FOMC possible qt is over fed is afraid of a recession interest rates are coming down that's one take but of course as the old saying goes show me the charts and I'll tell you the news what we see is that the market actually really liked this whole press conference we see that it drew down a little bit here and then it bounced right back up uh eventually making it you know well over this you can see this little uh resistance line that we had 1 2 uh three it was a pretty significant line here right so this particular resistance of around 85K was kind of holding us back and we busted through it obviously we'll see how long this holds if it holds uh but this was a pretty significant move up i want to be clear though uh these zones to me are still pretty key right we're not really full bullish until we get above 93 maybe 927 right this is that last high but this is still the no trade zone for me there's a little nibbling that could be done here i did a little nibbling on Bitcoin back here but I'm still waiting to make any big moves until we see a major move down or a major move up i want to see something exciting and decisive out of the market because right now it feels like we've seen a major turnover in the market and boring after a turnover is just not the area I'm trying to take big bets in personally but what I'm going to point out here is let's go back to 2019 right 2019 this is where they stopped quantitative tightening right you see here the balance sheet stopped being drawn down this is the the bottom line here and this is the Bitcoin price and so what we saw here is that even when they stopped quantitative tightening fully which of course would be good for risk assets you still saw the market kind of trend downwards obviously this particular uh jump down this was the COVID crash so let's just ignore the COVID crash but you still saw from the moment they uh stopped tightening the balance sheet you still saw Bitcoin draw down pretty significantly here right you saw from this line where they stopped reducing the balance sheet in fact they started immediately increasing the balance sheet here which we don't know if that's going to happen remember this is different uh we still saw Bitcoin work its way down and form new lows after that remember it had already topped and started to come down in you know when they started this in 2019 what I think is an even bigger thing to look at here is Ethereum and we had been looking at this comparison here uh between ETH in 2019 and ETH now and it does look very similar right we have these periods where Bitcoin dominance is exploding uh ETH is kind of working its way up but this is as the balance sheet is going down and you see almost just a longer version of it over the last 2 years or so and what we see is that ETH broke down then we get a quantitative tightening ending but once again look at ETH eth still made you know significant lower lows even before the CO stuff happened you had ETH come all the way down another 30% uh the ultimate COVID low was another 47% but that was this flash crash right so let's just ignore that uh that March 2020 crash and you still saw ETH come down significantly after real QT ended remember QT actually turned into QE you saw the the Fed started expanding its balance sheet down here not just going flat like over here so what we've seen is that Bitcoin and ETH even after quantitative tightening ended in 2019 they continued to make new lower lows again this is not a guaranteed law of the land there's only really one major data point we're looking at to see how things exactly behaved but it's important to realize that just cuz QT ends doesn't mean that QE has begun and it doesn't mean that we are guaranteed to see that be the ultimate low so as we see Bitcoin here in kind of this no trade zone uh it dipped a little into the nibble zone again this is just my reading i could be wrong about these zones but we know for sure that things aren't fully bullish buy back throw it all in until we get back above this 93K about 94K that's when it's like okay the market's telling us something that Bitcoin's ready to grow maybe global liquidity is all Bitcoin needs maybe all of this weakness in the US markets is not going to pull Bitcoin down anymore and Bitcoin of all assets is just going to be impossible to keep down so that's a possibility right and if Bitcoin gets above here into this zone I'll be buying back higher otherwise it still feels quite indecisive and another run up here into the red zone you know I would see that as probably another chance to sell uh and that the market is still you know working itself out remember QT hasn't fully ended they're still selling $40 billion a month worth of some equities and a lot of mortgage back securities so the Fed is still reducing its balance sheet it's still pulling money out of the market it's still making things harder on the market and interest rates are still pretty high and the Fed came out and they said \"Yeah we'll we'll you know give some more guidance.\" But they didn't say \"Hey we're going to cut interest rates down to 2% or 1%.\" The interest rates are targeting by the end of the year about 3.9% which is still pretty high you know it's still pretty high historically at least in my lifetime it's pretty high so this particular setup to me didn't urge me to do anything particularly differently and specifically when it comes to altcoins so was this rally just a reflexive rally did the market actually see this as a full dovish pivot i'm not so sure i think that we're seeing a little bit of this play into uh the effect where we're seeing again there's supposed to be some big announcement tomorrow that Trump's making i think we've learned our lesson in the big announcements that is coming out of Trump's White House i think you need to see Congress pass legislation for it to be very impactful or we need to hear details of how they're going to start buying Bitcoin with the federal balance sheet right now it doesn't feel like that's a priority so I think the changes coming out of Trump are pretty long-term amazing golden era but short-term we need to get through this sticky period and again we're seeing another like headline driven rumor-driven pump is my take on this and that has led to some pretty significant sell-offs and so maybe maybe if this is huge if this is like some massive actionable immediate financially beneficial to crypto holders thing I think this is huge we don't know yet again I stay open-minded here but I wouldn't be surprised to see Bitcoin you know push somewhere up into the raise cash zone and then start to sell off again i I don't hope that happens but that's just going to be my plan so the reality is I'll still be looking to raise a bit more cash in this red zone and I've seen all the comments on Twitter where whenever I talk about this people say \"Well that's coming from you you know you sold everything.\" I don't think people understand this for me to exit positions especially in a lot of the altcoins would take me i mean the original plan was to spend months and months doing this in a very slow and structured way and especially after the market has crashed it's even harder to sell a lot of these altcoins so I'm not rushing to the door to sell these things and in fact I haven't sold the vast majority of my lower cap altcoins i sold some major alts like Salana i sold stuff that was big and liquid and easy but I'm still holding the vast majority of my holdings like I told you I would i'm not just going to go rush and try to nuke the charts that wouldn't be kind to you guys or the projects that I believe in it's just not the right way to do it so I hold so believe me I'm still holding a ton of these things there's no path to dump these especially when I hold a ton of a lot of these assets so the reality is even though I think we're going to go down more make no mistake I would be much much richer if we just blew through to the upside and everything started printing green candles trust me that would be the happiest day ever for me i promise you i'm just trying to play this right to make use of the liquid funds that I have to get in and out of some of the bigger stuff so this is how I see things i will try to sell stuff if we end up edging up into this uh upper red zone here and again I will be wrong and start to buy stuff back and flip bullish again if we get into this green zone because Bitcoin is known to do Bitcoin things and so what will I be buying if we do make it all the way back into that green zone well to be honest given what I'm seeing here I still think it's going to be a little bit before we get this sustainable durable crazy altcoin season so I'll be piling mostly into Bitcoin with some Ethereum and Salana i mean that's just going to be my breakdown i think that it's just the obvious trade and I think there could be a situation where until interest rates sort of come down and the conditions start to loosen bitcoin might just continue to behave in its own world bitcoin dominance could continue to creep up and we won't see the alt season that's going to make us all filthy rich until we see the full cycle of the Fed getting on board ending QT properly not partially but properly and then coming in and starting to say \"Look we've done the damage the economy is reset we're ready.\" because I believe in that world Trump is going to start funding his projects bringing on quite a bit of debt as well and these will become stimulative it will become inflationary and once again I believe that the asset holders which very well might be the US government on behalf of US citizens will all benefit hugely hugely from this and so this game is pretty simple to me you want to wait for these cues because it could get kind of ugly before these massive pivots but once the pivot happens I think we will see not only the golden age of like a few months of crazy wet and wild bull run but I think we'll see years potentially a decade of crypto progress that will resemble you know the greatest version of the stock market where it just continues to go up and up and up i think that's what we're looking for but I don't know what's between now and the solid footing for altcoins and so my only plan right now is to accumulate mostly Bitcoin 80% Bitcoin with my buys or Bitcoin adjacent bets like Coinbase stock Micro Strategy whatever you want to see that is like a Bitcoin ccentric buy but I'm not going to be flooding heavily into the altcoins again remember I still hold a lot of these like I still hold an astronomical amount because I'm not just going to dump these but my trades based on this will be heavily focused on accumulating Bitcoin which could in theory just continue to grind up with global liquidity even if altcoins just continue to lag and remember this is a world where Salana is actually going to get an ETF on the stock market uh the what is this the Volatility Shares LLC is doing a Salana ETF which goes live this week this should have set the world ablaze but this is Salana right i mean even today it's up from 120 to 130 right this is not a massive reaction right you have Salana down from the peak uh what is this 55% at the lows it was 60% down here uh remember we had this line here the 120 is obviously a good value zone but again this is not a major reaction so you're seeing here there's just a lot of weakness in alts and again I still think Salana is a smash buy and it's going to be a huge huge blockchain that will have massive massive wealth generation once the conditions loosen but you know if they keep getting uglier we might get Salana at 80 bucks we might get Salana sub 100 and I'm going to be going crazy on those Salanas if we get that opportunity because I know that the golden age is coming i just don't want to miss the opportunity to load up heavily in the precursor to that now for altcoins beyond what we're seeing here of just Salana Ethereum Bitcoin obviously the stuff that has been battle tested that has survived multiple cycles right the stuff that has been beaten down and come back time after time those are going to be the things that you want to get into you don't want to get into something fresh that has a a new chart that you can't see if it's going to survive you just don't know you want to be very careful and I would say that if you have a favorite altcoin that you belove obviously you know we love one in particular Super in the end Super is a multicycle asset it went through a crushing bare market it's been through a few cycle lows and you guys know I'm like a dog with a bone i'm not giving up on this one however not all altcoins will abide by those rules and I'm very very scared of ultra low cap altcoins because the liquidity is just not there those could easily just keep dropping and dropping and dropping we don't know what's going to happen so make sure that if you get into altcoins on this dip you're in projects that you know are going to have that next catalyst that are always going to be pushing so to summarize I would be heavily focused on Bitcoin buys on this dip until we get the firm pivot out of the Fed and that could come any time but I do believe if I were to put together the rhetoric coming out of the Trump White House administration the rhetoric coming out of the Federal Reserve the actual decisions that we just saw made today at FOMC which is yes it's a reduction almost to zero but not really if you look at the fine print they're still selling mortgage back securities they're still selling treasuries so they're still selling $40 billion a month it's not even a full end to QT and then you look at historically what happened with QT and last cycles and even when they fully ended QT and started stimulating again there was still another last sort of flail down from the markets so could this happen again could we see another flail down from the markets if history is any guide we could absolutely see that and I'm personally want to be buying so aggressively during those dips because what comes next is not only a pivot on the liquidity side of things but every single surrounding aspect of crypto from what we will expect with regulatory clarity to you heard Scott Besson he's going to be putting the American people on the asset ownership side of the equation he's going to be formulating buckets of assets that are going to benefit the US citizens long term through the sovereign wealth fund and Bitcoin we know for sure to be part of this digital asset stockpile in the sovereign wealth fund this is what's happening read between the lines because even though assets might struggle here over the next few months long-term we're about to see an absolutely crazy long-term shift in liquidity in the value of owning assets and hopefully it's complemented with an increase in quality of life here in the United States not a decrease which is kind of what we've come to expect inflation's going to ruin quality of life but we'll all get rich holding Bitcoin well what if we could all get rich holding crypto and Bitcoin and quality of life in the country could improve too that's the hope that is the tightroppe walk that we're walking and let's see if we can pull it off but the one thing I'll urge you to do is remain a little patient because this next step might be a doozy we think that they're trying to land the plane by slowing down into the landing but they might just crash it pick it up build a new one and set us off on our next journey so it's important to realize that we can't predict how the landing is going to go and that's exactly the stage we're in we're trying to fully land the plane on quantitative tightening and whether that landing is hard soft invisible you know first class you're just drinking your martini we're going to find out but I would say that getting ahead of your skis here is not the right approach and I'm going to be doing my best to keep you informed as at least to my opinion my view on this cuz I do think we have a whole lot to look forward to however I don't think it's coming today i think it's coming very soon and I think it could change at any moment given what we're seeing out of Jerome Powell and the Fed it seems like they're really happy about the progress that Trump is making they're not concerned about the tariffs and we're starting to see some real progress here anyways that's all I have for you some really awesome project updates i highly encourage you guys to stay intimately aware of what's going on within crypto because once the market turns you're going to want to have your targets set on what you're going to buy the communities you want to be a part of and the projects that did not stop crushing it throughout this bearish downturnish maybe a bull maybe 2019 maybe a bear I don't know let's not get into the labels but throughout this period of absolute misery let's just call it who stayed cranking who stayed engaged you're going to want them on a short list and you know we are not giving up anytime soon as always I'll see you very soon on the next episode [Music]"
