    "transcript": " crypto gaming is expected to explode over the next 10 years onboarding hundreds of millions of average people into crypto without them even knowing here are my top 10 crypto gaming coins to watch in 2025 keep in mind I'm not a financial adviser nor can I see the future investing in crypto in general is always very risky so never invest more than you're willing to lose also I own these coins or many of these coins or I'm an adviser for some of these coins the projects meaning my money is where my mouth is having said that like the video If you appreciate this content and let's start with coin number one on today's list a mutable think of a mutable as the infrastructure of crypto gaming meaning unlike in ethereum or Solana or Supra that are general purpose blockchains anybody can build anything on those blockchains a mutable is specifically tailored for gaming developers and gaming projects to build on their infrastructure looking at the growth a mutable has just surpassed Ronin another gaming blockchain in monthly active users more games migrated onto a mutable in 2024 than any other blockchain they saw 33 games migrate from other chains and with their release last year of a mutable ZK evm the growth is undeniable since we launched a mutable zkm in betat up we've taken it to be one of the fastest grain chains in history last year we signed 140 games it was our record year this year we've signed more than 220 already and we're still going and it includes leading companies like net marble South Korea's largest Mobile gaming company by revenue and there are gems in this ecosystem let's highlight some of those specific games by the end of today's video but just know with the mutable it's an infrastructure play meaning I'm betting on the space evolving and I'm investing in the infrastructure and speaking of this next coin on today's list superverse actually super is not so much an infrastructure play to me but a community coin uniting the communities of some of the best crypto games in the space friend of the channel and founder Elliot expains you can think of super as the community coin of gaming as the currency of gaming the coin that is in every single game regardless of whatever chain it's on regardless of whatever stack it's using this is how the community flows between all of the games and it's effectively the gaming cult and that's why if you go on the timeline you'll see people going crazy showing their love for super because in my opinion it's the most fun way to get involved in all of the gaming projects and it's a good first stop and I believe it will be the first stop for most people as they come into crypto gaming subscribers know I'm an investor in the project I've literally been bringing Elliot on for years to keep me updated what's next for super Farm I'm a superverse meaning I'm betting on the space evolving all the best games one token and I mean literally you can look at some of the top games in the space super is being integrated into all of them and whether that means you can use super for in-game purchases or special nft merch by completing certain quests per game this is an infrastructure play I say that but really commun Community play for me super is unifying all of them xorg is another crypto protocol to watch they're focused on player identity meaning giving Gamers ownership of their in-game identity actually owning it and major Esports teams are actually adopting them so when you think of xborg think of Esports they're being used today leadership of xborg explains what xborg is is this big Ledger of of fuel data that you've gathered and generated as a player and then we not only create this ID but we also create a whole bunch of developer infrastructure so that apps and and games can use your ID in game or within different apps we're doing a lot of Partnerships and Integrations with Esports teams that use our protocol Team Liquid for example so looking at last year 2024 was an incredible year for xborg over 25,000 plus holders they grew to in a thriving Community they partnered with those Esports teams as well as Wormhole and if you're asking why people are seeing the potential at the heart of this lies the xorg ID think of it as a universal digital identity a CV of your digital activity that Aggregates your achievements activity and reputation across platforms and why this is significant is because today your data is fragmented your gaming history sits on steam or Playstation your blockchain achievements are scattered and none of it's connected this limits the potential for tools like AI agents to deliver truly personal ized experiences xborg is built to solve this next coin to keep on the radar and sort of the Candy Crush of web 3 gaming is my lovely Planet they're a long-term partner of the channel and most subscribers will remember I shared with you this game over 6 months ago here's a 20 second clip from back then next coin on today's list is an upand cominging crypto game it's called My Lovely planet and actually it's one of the fastest growing web 3 mobile games on the App Store and Google Play and this is my type of game I love these just casual don't really have to think about it but are just fun you can just play on your phone and how they differentiate themselves well they're the world's first impact driven web 3 mobile game meaning they helped the planet there's been over 359,000 trees planted in Madagascar Kenya and France just for people playing it's led by industry veterans meaning it's not only backed by Ubisoft and unity but also some team members directly from prominent web 2 games like Candy Crush as well as over 900,000 Instagram followers and growing and in a message from them on what's to come in 2025 2025 is going to be insane it's not a promise it's a fact we proved our ability to deliver and we'll do it again here are the four biggest achievements so far and what's coming next so as of now there's over 300,000 players on the beta version of our game it's a game with a D1 retention equivalent to Candy Crush a team with top talent from industry leaders like Candy Crush and Royal match and an acquisition cost 20 times lower than industry standards they're going for a million plus players in 2025 link down below to check them out now and the final thing I'll say the news today is this we are burning 34% of mlc Supply it's a game changer and obviously this decreases the token inflation and increases the confidence of current holders something to keep on the radar and next gaming coin on our list and this may be surprising to some people Avalanche what's exciting me actually is this massive upgrade we have in avalanche um that's coming up because I see 75 different games that's going to launch in the next year or so this is a general purpose but with also focus on gaming blockchain from action RPGs to realtime strategies avac and its subnets have a wide array of web 3 games the three on my radar would be defi Kingdom shrapnel and Off the Grid president of avax explains the growth because I see 75 different games that's going to launch in the next year or so uh that's over 20 different call it l1s on you know the different variable uh different various you know Avalanche l1s I am looking forward to them and seeing how the composability the connectivity of all that so really it's because of how the avac blockchain is set up allowing subnets subnets which allows connectivity composability is why developers are choosing avac the avac game making the most noise is Off the Grid I'm running nodes for Off the Grid the reason they're making so much noise is because unlike the games in 2021 and a lot of them were just all promised Off the Grid is available on Playstation today Xbox today there are a couple of verticals that are really growing and one is gaming on Avalanche yeah you guys have done a good job with that so far you got that what was the huge game you've just don't that's just oh there's a couple but um gonzilla GD a small step for avac a massive leap for web 3 gaming ninja was playing this game on his live stream Dr disrespect was playing this game off the grid brand new extraction Battle Royale it's coming out um Early Access is going to be streaming it all week off the grid in a lot of ways is the gateway to web through gaming because 3.5 million wallets for aaac were created most of them were web to Gamers and they were just signing up for the game they don't didn't even know they were downloading necessarily A crypto wallet it was a top three shooter game in General on Twitch and over 42 million transactions brought to the avax blockchain also another blockchain to keep on the radar that I think is not only thriving today but has so much more potential to grow in gaming is ton coin this is telegram's ecosystem and that's cuz telegram already has a builtin user base of over 950 million monthly active users other blockchains wish they had distribution like this ton coin has it NCoin was a crypto game that blew up last year on Telegram and it was simple just click click click such simple games cooko games a project I'm invested in is play and earn on avac and on telegram so they have a great team they have people from Riot games Activision Gala games who has helped create some of the biggest titles in history like Call of Duty mobile League of Legends also Candy Crush and backed by a lot of solid Ang like me I really like them because they're focused on games that I like which are classic casual games like the classic snake where you can win Cocos and then use those Cocos and redeem for AAC ever made real money playing snake well Coco snake is live now daily tournaments and free nfts on avac available for probably another week and a half and just casual games like this so if you like the ton coin or avac ecosystem you like this and that brings us to specific games I'm much more of an infrastructure guy because again no matter which crypto game makes it in the end many won't but some will the infrastructure usually benefits I think alivium is a game to watch this is where you're trying to survive a mysterious planet and capture these aluvial these creatures I think the gameplay looks really cool and they also have an arena where you can battle sort of Pokemon or Mortal Kombat esque looks cool to me I think another coin that has a very strong Community is wag me games now this is an OG in the space I'm going to have to do more research I'm going to have to check back in on them in 2025 because a lot has changed but something on my radar for 2025 another game I like is cross the ages because it's based on a series of science fiction novels so it comes with its own built-in audience in that sense and if we're looking into 2025 for immutable Revenge has just been named one of immutable Flagship games of 2025 so this is a new game I'm an adviser for everreach labs the company behind it and this is powered by IMX and again to me this looks cool and how are they different well this is not just another shooter game it was created by veterans behind Far Cry 3 Rainbow 6 Siege and fortnite revenge redefines what's possible in gaming and in this influencer world where people like to stream their games we see this on Twitch we see this on Tik Tok streamers love this with Revenge Spectators don't just watch they shape the action so viewers can modify and environments drop upgrades and Trigger events that change the course of every match I think this could be a big differentiator when these major twitch streamers choose which games do they want to play they're going to want to choose the one that's the most interactive With Their audience comment down below which cryptocoin or which game spoke to you the most let's see what gets the most comments and like always see you tomorrow"
