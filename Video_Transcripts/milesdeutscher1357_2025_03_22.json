    "transcript": " what's up guys I'm here with Jose from dely very excited to be having a conversation with you today we're going to dive deep into the market where we're at this cycle AI what you're investing in right now been a while since you've last been on the channel so it's good to have you back really good to be here man congrats on all the growth no thank you very much I think the we've done two podcasts and both are in 2023 so I don't know why it's been a couple years since we're running it back but obviously A lot's happened so we've got plenty to discuss absolutely excited for it I guess it's kind of a big question but since it's been so long since we've last done a podcast I want to ask you like what are your thoughts on everything that's happened 2024 obviously was a crazy Year many ups and downs now heading into another weird period in the market where it's very macro focused like overall H how would you summarize the year and what were your major takeaways from the year yeah I mean overall it's definitely been kind of a weird cycle uh it's been pretty brutal pretty brutal dispersion right there was like a couple of names that you really had to be in to to outperform um and then there was a bunch of like pump fake rotations uh and we were talking before the show that pretty much since uh 21 like hudders and True Believers have just gotten destroyed on on everything you know like if you if you huddled uh like us you got wrecked if you huddled through like FTX you got wrecked um and then all the rotations since there since then like you had GMX and like the the sort of cash flow generating things on chain then you had like gamble fly with robit then you had like social F stuff frch it was the worst like my my worst trade this cycle probably went straight down no not a single not a single pump um then you had like uh memes memes got destroyed and you had like a mini AI cycle for three months and like it's just been I think brutal for people um but overall I I am seeing like pretty significant progress It's it's kind of a weird time in the market because I feel like uh and in the world you you have to be able to keep uh thoughts that are somewhat contradicting in your head in order to to perform well and people really struggle to to do that um and I think it's fair to say that like most of crypto is still wildly overvalued and is is going to Trend to zero like most of the of the tokens here um they're just like there's a lot of like pure vaporware and just stuff that didn't isn't vaporware but didn't hit pmf right and that's that's like not to that doesn't mean that the industry is a scam it just means that we gave liquidity to a bunch of like seed and and series a style projects and that that's what would have happened if we did that with with with equities too so it's kind of to be expected um and then at the same time Bitcoin has never been in a better spot in my mind you have ETFs you have the US government like literally talking about making the US the crypto Capital putting Bitcoin in a strategic Reserve looking for Budget neutral ways to acquire more Bitcoin you have States acquiring Bitcoin there's countries acquiring Bitcoin like all the stuff that we've been talking about for years is happening and at the same time the world is getting way more multipolar um like it's not the the end of History you know us like protecting the whole world and and and everyone doesn't have to invest in their own defense and that's like I think a very good climate for for Bitcoin it's kind of the climate in which gold like instruments Thrive and Bitcoin gets to prove that it is the better gold um and then there are also like pockets of things happening in crypto where you see real use cases and real product Market fit I think one of them is is stable coins that's like one of the ones I'm most excited about um you're seeing obviously stripe invest a billion dollars into buying bridge then prioritize stable coins calling them room temperature semiconductors for financial services like and you're really seeing traction with that like SpaceX paying out employees with it uh like some of these remittances corridors and and and and payments are starting to work and I think this cycle you're just going to see up only in terms of and and also like most importantly the US finally recognizes stable coins as a tool to extend dollar hemony and not a threat right like you already lost control of your dollar with the euro dollar system stable coins are just like better Tech it's like onchain digital euro dollar and so that that's huge a huge Tailwind um and then at the same time macro looks weird right we're in a transition period Trump's putting up these these tariffs um like elon's cutting uh trying to cut a trillion dollar out of government spending at the same time as you're putting in tariffs like overall this is austerity right you're going to pull a trillion a trillion and a half out of the economy we saw what happened when they when they in Ed it in so it's kind of like scary to be uh in this like regime shift and so there's like these yeah there's these ideas you have to like kind of contradicting ideas that you have to keep in your head uh to be able to navigate this Market um and and for me yeah I mean for me the the best way to that I find to do it is just to try and really stay focused on like the long term and not trade too much like trading takes up a lot of mental energy for me um it's like exhausting and draining like of my my soul um and also I feel like the time I spent trading like thinking about these short-term movements is is not additive at all to my overall like worldview it doesn't like compound my knowledge in ways that can help me make better investments in future um and what I really like is when you find something that you're bullish about a Founder a team that you're bullish about and you can bet on them for for like you know multi-year periods because then it's like okay I don't have to think about this anymore I can go focus on like the next thing um I don't have to keep keep worrying about what's happening um and I think they're like I I posted a thread the other day I think there pockets of things now that you can bet on for the long term and be uh pretty confident that this is going to be like a reasonable entry as how do you balance that though like the the long-term framework obviously I think most people would prefer to to invest longterm if they could because it takes like as you said a lot of the the mental drainage away but it's so difficult in the space because I feel like this cycle especially if you weren't able to like just secure the profits on like a one to two month rotation you just end up getting wrecked so how do you balance like making money in the space and also having a long-term Outlook yeah that's a great question um obviously we we were in a more fortunate position in terms that we did well last cycle so in the the there was some amount of like preservation we could do rather than having to be super aggressive um and then the main thing I think that's useful to remember is that if you're focusing on long-term trends there will be short-term opportunities that show up uh where you can you can do really well right like for instance if you were bullish on stablecoins this cycle you thought okay I think stable coins are going to go to a trillion this is like a narrative that's clearly secular it's happening whether crypto grows or not then you could have done like you could have been paying attention to Athena and you could have bought the YT in the in the first season and and made you know 10x your your money in a month or whatever if you if if you timed it right or you could have just farmed Athena in the second season H held the token and and and made a made a big return on your on your yield or you could have done usual right the usual yts also printed money uh or you could have been early to resolve which we don't know how that's how that's going to do but it but it could be a good one um and and there's also obviously stuff in private markets that people have been doing that I think will do will do really well uh in the same way like if if you're bullish on okay I think asset ledgers like l1's like asset issuance platforms are going to do well um there was like ample time to kind of buy salana right we published like a big bullish report on salana like pretty close to the to the bottom um it was clear that that the chain wasn't going away and you would have been been able to buy that and kind of like hold it and even if you didn't sell the top you'd still be up like you know 12 13x from from the bottom and you'd be you'd be fine um I think where people get screwed is getting chopped up chasing narratives you know like I did not make any money on memes I did not make any money on AI coins uh in fact I lost money on AI coins because I I bought the I I bought this kind of dip a little bit too early but uh I didn't participate in memes and I coins I participated I you weren't trading any memes just for fun I mean I I punted like you know like literally bips of portfolio on on some memes like for just just to scratch the itch but I did not put significant size into any memes and it was I know some funds like major players in the space were actually starting to like allocate and launch their own memes which is crazy to think about like big funds you probably know some of as well yeah I mean we actually like passed on the pump fun round as well at 20 million uh one of our probably one of our bigger mistakes this this cycle we've you know you always make a few uh we just didn't think there was like an association thing as well with being associated with something called pump fun but um we yeah I mean a lot of people at Deli do did trade memes on PA we didn't do anything as a as an entity as a as an organization either through Ventures or through any of the through any of the branches um and I didn't participate personally and it just I think saved a lot of mental space and and energy uh when I said like I don't really believe in this long term I think it's a game of hot potato I don't know where I am on the you know the meme of the birds [\u00a0__\u00a0] on each other like like I don't know which layer I'm at when I get these tips from people um and it's just going to be stressful like I can't size it and so like if I do size it I'm going to be stressed out looking at it like when do I sell um and so I've just kind of learned to avoid those games and you kind of have to like fomo is the mind killer and just just sort of stand your lane and realize that you're always one good opportunity away from uh like in this game especially in crypto you're one good call away from like generational wealth you know and it only needs one that you have conviction in and you can size um conviction is like the most important thing I think to like develop and you and for conviction you do need like long-term DCS you do need to put in the research at least for me like I think a lot of people did really well on memes and could time the can can do technicals or just like sense the animal spirits and and and get out on time that's not really my game so I kind of avoid uh playing it I guess the longer term your outlook the higher probability that your thesis is correct because there are so many variables which can intrude short term whether it be price action or some new trade or it becomes much harder to actually extract the maximum value out of that thesis absolutely yeah I think it's weird for me it's easier to predict like two to five years out than like six months out because you kind of know what a rational like endgame looks like for for lot of these things for for the and you can kind of see the see the initial tea leaves um but six months out it's it's really difficult like no one would have predicted I think memes doing what they did this cycle AI coins came out of left field like there's a bunch of of of narratives like that so yeah I don't know that's that's my uh like some people are good at the short-term training and and like being in the trenches and stuff um I I personally would not it's not my game and not and so not the one I'd recommend so I I have a question that that came out of a comment that you made before you mentioned how you missed um pump fun I actually just did a video on my biggest mistakes this cycle so I named like the 10 screw-ups that I made I'm interested if you want to share like what are your biggest mistakes because I also saw has did his post on like the all the Investments he missed I mean we all talk about our wins like obviously had Athena and some huge wins but like what are some of the other Fades that you've had this cycle this cycle yeah this cycle I mean Pump fun is the one that comes to mind as being like the biggest we also passed on Aether I was telling you when it was called M1 I think the round was like 80 million or something uh it was like the longest I process we've had going back and forth like we like the team but we' we'd uh like the decentralized compute space was a tough one for us to see where attration would come from like we had also historically passed on aash I think that was like 8 mil as well so there's been it's been some mistakes over the years um so I think probably yeah pump fun Aether I remember us passing on in terms of seed deals um last cycle we passed on ens at like 10 mil you know would have been a 100 to to 200x crazy one um and I think the in terms of yeah I mean there's those are those are the bigger mistakes I could can I can think of there's probably ex based mistakes [Music] um honestly uh Athena is an interesting one where we we managed to like we we got into the first round but not uh like guy it's a funny story like guy was a subscriber to our research back in 2020 and uh he was like we had this institutional plus tier where they like we gave people special attention and they they got access to to to Deals and stuff like this and he uh he was like one of the smartest subscribers we had like he would send us Farms that we hadn't heard about and stuff meanwhile he had a full-time job in private Equity so we were really bullish on him and at some point and we also like got really close with him so at some point we made him an offer to to join Deli um uh and he passed because he had like an actual career you know like he was at cus like big private Equity Firm and then he kind of watched our rise from the from the sidelines and and he he says he told us he was like not sleeping thinking about it because he he could we offered him to come in on the fun like when when he had sort of like single digit millions of of a um and then he came back and did Athena and obviously he's he's succeeded far beyond uh all of us and and also like when but when he came he wanted to like surprise us because we hadn't seen him in like two years so uh I ended up like he was messaging me and I didn't know who like I it didn't go through my messages and so by the time I got on the phone with him uh and like I saw him I was like holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] it's you like I haven't seen you in years there wasn't much left on the around so we didn't end up sizing the first round as as good as we we could have that was probably a mistaken execution um it's crazy I I actually my my one meme coin that I that I did ape was like fart coin um the just because it was the only one where I was like okay this is at the intersect of the AI narrative where like you know uh token terminal owned a bunch of owned more fart coin than than goat actually and it's like a very simple meme that I could see like really pissing people off and being like a barometer of of just Financial Madness you know like okay fart coins at two Bill like what is what is happening in the world you know and like tradire really like uh and I love the the hot air rises um I kind of went outside my my bread and butter there and and bought fcoin and and promptly lost you know like 60% or something on on on that um it's a good lesson though about having an edge right like if you don't have an edge in a game just don't play it I think people will also fall into that trap like retail investors they'll try and become an expert on defi AI short-term trading long-term investment and and kind of all gets confused and then they never really end up building like a big Edge in just one thing so I think like the number one advice I give to people in crypto well there's probably two things one preserve Capital that's like so important it's like a fundamental thing you need to do to survive and two pick like one thing and go really deep into it because as you said before if you have a long-term thesis about something you'll probably end up finding like short to midterm opportunities just if you're in the right absolutely and I've always run like I think another thing that's useful with this stuff is like countert trading your psychology and kind of realizing that when you're feeling the most fomo like especially if you're somewhat disciplined and like you understand your Edge when you're feeling the most fomo to enter the memes or AI that's probably the closest to the top right um and and it's it's the same on the on on the way down like when you're feeling like oh [\u00a0__\u00a0] this this this stuff's dead I should probably just sell and Pres what I have that's like close to the bottom uh and cter feel last week last week I'm like I got to I got to preserve and it was bottom bottom the the chop is the worst the chop is what kills people right like you you you kind of because you have these big drw downs and people are are kind of like mentally uh still in the bull market they're like this is just a bull market uh pull pullback we're going to bounce uh and then when the bounce doesn't come and it starts and it starts like uh TR like um um sort of chopping here people are like [\u00a0__\u00a0] what if it chops and then and then like makes a makes a lower low like I can't handle more pain and then you kind of sell right um You chop yourself out I did I did a yeah I've done that in the past for sure so I think yeah counter training your psychology is really useful and understanding your Edge I think is honestly the most useful thing like another thing for me is I I like to run very concentrated on my PA and I like to have a decent am amount of stables at all times especially when yields the cycle have like if you in the right Farms been like 50 to 150% like the whole the whole cycle and so for me it was just very uh useful to have like at Old Times um like a 25 to to to percent or higher like stable allocation that I could that I was just farming with um and often like throughout the cycle especially when the the stable Farms are good I went as high as like 50 60% in in Stables just because if I could lock in this kind of yield um it made more sense to me than than than a lot of the opportunities I was seeing in the market and then I run like very concentrated positions like my other positions I'll have maybe two or three like large positions um and I just find it much easier to mentally um like be able to stay in the game handle swings still do my like day job if if I if I run that way versus having like thousands of tiny positions that you don't understand well you don't know when to sell like all this sort of cognitive overload and cognitive um yeah cognitive overload of of like having to figure out what to do with these thousands of positions and teams and things like this he's still holding ethereum I saw your funny tweet the other day about you're gonna hold to zero yeah I'm still holding ethereum honestly ethereum is like the first thing I bought in in crypto um so I think Al was hold and I like really uh I'm really like grateful to ethereum for kind of birthing this this space and and metalic I'll probably hold like the position I have now I would I would probably I don't I don't see myself selling it it's like pretty small position of of portfolio um and what I said in the Tweet is kind of true it's just like if I sold it now and it pumped I would hate myself much more than writing it to zero at this point um and I'm I'm I'm bullish ethereum I know it's like uh but I just think in like I've been through enough Cycles to know that people uh price action leads narrative and when people when when price action is bad people make up narratives to to fit this and then they go look for data to to confirm that and like right now the big narrative is that l2s are are cab ballistic to ethereum and ethereum is not benefiting from from from the growth in l2s and fees and stuff like this but like no one's asking about Ripple whe you know where whether like they're they're generating enough fees to justify the valuation or or cardano or like look at the top 10 assets um and and I also don't think people are really buying salana because of the on a PE basis like I don't think that's how people value this this this stuff um yeah I think I think e clearly made a bunch of mistakes um many of which i' I've pointed out but it's still like by far the the leader um maybe no maybe by as little a distance as it's ever been but still still the leader um so yeah I still hold some E I want to ask you about the L1 I don't have a thesis but I still something just blindly holding um I I want to ask you about the L1 space a bit later but I want to cycle back to that exact word cycle it's something we we say a lot you know last cycle this cycle like are we even in a cycle because I've started to float the theory recently and it's not really a theory it's I think there's a lot of logic behind like the fact that the Foy cycle probably is dead I mean that's at least my opinion that I mean there's such a limited data set right and we're in such a different macro and liquidity environment like how can you extrapolate the previous fouryear cycle to where we are now but I'd love to hear your take on that question because I think it's what a lot of people are asking like are we in a cycle what is this are we in a bull market are we in a bare market like what the hell's going on here yeah um I think there are always Cycles I think Cycles I mean the Bitcoin having maybe they won't be centered around the Bitcoin having but Cycles are based on human nature right rather than uh I I don't think it's based on the I mean the Bitcoin having obviously like provided a good shelling point for it I I don't know if that'll continue to happen in future but there's always going to be Cycles especially in crypto and it's just like when like in the economy they're they're they're sort of driven by these like small and and long credit Cycles right where people take out debt and debt you're literally borrowing from the future right so at some point in the future you have to pay that back and so naturally you have like this this this this natural cycle that that that happens and I think the The Reflex of psychology is like when things get good you want to take out more leverage you wna buy more people get super over excited the fundamentals also look better because uh you know one person spending is is another person's earnings and it sort of gets to a point where it can't um go up anymore and then you have this crash and it's reflexive to the downside right and people get really depressed um like credit dries up um everyone is sold everyone is sitting in Stables like the bitcoin's over um like uh you know the China bans Bitcoin close to the bottom you know like all all this stuff that we've seen like this playbook play out and then um the cycle comes come comes back so I do think they're grounded in Psychology and no matter how good things are humans will always think they're even better um like they'll always find a way to imagine like if the US government buys the S pumps it's going to it's going to be like uh I don't know we're going to replace all the gold reserves in Fort KNX with with Bitcoin and every country is goingon to buy buy Bitcoin and and we're gonna have like Bitcoin back dollars and and all this stuff and on the on the downside it's the same people always think uh people always think it's worse than than it is and so that naturally creates these these Cycles I think so I think we'll always have Cycles yeah do you think they they might be like shortened like we could see like a bunch of mini cycles or do you still think we're going to follow like these big uh like Bitcoin and crypto like bull markets and and big long extended bare markets um I think uh if I had to like I'm not sure my my opinion on this is is um is super super valuable but I think if we had to if I have to say I do think it's going to be driven around Bitcoin and that we'll always have Cycles because Bitcoin just doesn't have fundamentals like really and and it's such a reflexive asset um and I do think um this the like I don't know if it's this cycle or the next one but there will be a a macro a Bitcoin top that's driven by like nation state fomo you know where kind of similar to the gold cycle when in the in the early 20th century right where um and late 19th century where you had like it wasn't clear what the the the store value was going to be whether it was going to be silver or gold and like uh China famously like converted their their reserves to Gold really late and so they they got Ed right um they they like lost you know I think 50% or whatever versus the US who which converted much earlier and that that psychology is going to start playing in at some point I think with Bitcoin where people are going to feel like they're being left behind countries are going to feel like it's their way to Leap Frog um Economic Development and so I just think you're you're you're gonna have almost gonna have cycles and I think they're mainly going to be driven around like uh Bitcoin like fomo and and and and fud around around Bitcoin I agree with you yeah yeah I think bitcoin's in the best place it's probably ever been from a fundamental point of VI but I just wonder how that relates to the altcoin market obviously something you've spoken a lot about is like betting on alth product Market fit how do you view the overall altcoin cycle like following Bitcoin like do you think if Bitcoin goes to 200k like Ulta guaranteed to follow obviously we've seen a lot of dispersion so like you have to make sure you're in the right you know bets to capitalize on that um basically my question is it's kind of a longwind way of asking like how do you view the relationship between Bitcoin and alts going forward yeah um I think there will uh like always be all seasons like I think people and I think if Bitcoin goes to 200k we'll definitely have like violent all season I don't think we'll ever have uh a 2021 everything goes up all season um I think there's going to be way more like pockets of of outperformance and way more dispersion and there's definitely the chance people will get caught in the wrong alts and uh and and they'll just go to zero like the thing with um you know stocks have um like stocks go up right because like uh they they make more cash flows the economy grows there there's GDP goes up and stocks just capture some percentage of that all the gravity pulls like stocks the gravity pulls them up alt the gravity really pulls them down right because you have and in in most cases you have a bunch of insiders that want to sell uh and in a lot of cases you have inflation schedules and so you need uh either new buyers or for the protocol to be generating enough fees to either buy its own token or you know justify people buying it on a fundamental basis and if you look around the space uh there's very few things that do that you know um so I do think and and and there's a lot of vaporware like you you just have to be honest with ourselves like when we look at this stuff does it really deserve multi-billion dollar valuations for for some of these things like I think I think the answer is no and over time um I think the market trends to to like rationality and so and also like people it's harder for people to believe in these in these narratives just given what what's happened in crypto and you know in 2021 there's like nfts everything's going to be an nft and like all the most valuable art is going to be nfts and the metaverse and and crypto gaming and stuff like this right now like the industry is more jaded than than ever um and actually even the pockets of outperformance that you're seeing are very sort of antithetical to the eth to the original ethos of the industry right like we didn't get into this uh or like maybe some people did but uh definitely not me and and most of the people from from my generation to have uh tokenized dollars in a bank account you know like I for dollars in a bank account is is the killer use case right now like it's it's a little bit depressing or even like hyper liquid success I'm bullish hyper liquid like that thing was basically like a sort of a centralized exchange for for for for quite a while with probably worse like trust guarantees um so yeah I think there's going to be more dispersion than is basically the the allseason but a lot of dispersion but there are products of course in the market that uh are going to be outliers I love this tweet from you about um just looking at products with like real product Market fit and you outlined three quite an extensive post so I won't read it out now go and read it if you if you have time and you're watching this but um you can kind of give us a summary here you you outlined token issuance so l1's Niche tokens exchanges and stable coins why are these the three verticals that that you viewers having the the strongest product Market fit I mean if if you think about what people are willing to pay for in crypto like what what are people actually willing to to spend money on which to me is the best indicator of product Market fit uh they're willing to to spend money to like access Blu space both both pay for Block space and Priority Access to block space right with me um they're willing to pay money to trade coins like that's that's very clear trade coins spot trade coins on Leverage and they're willing to to like hold stable coins hold and transfer like stable coins and so I I basically think those are the like the three like your your core parts of your portfolio should be built around the things that already have product Market fit in your in your liquid portfolio and then you should be taking like bets on stuff that you think will have future product Market fit right like Venture style bets um smaller size at good valuations and so that's kind of how I uh and obviously I have like we have a big Venture book with with Ventures so I I gen generally structure my PA a little bit more conservatively like I have more stables at all times and stuff like this but I still think the the kind of the same concept applies and I I want to own basically the leaders in those three in those three spaces and for me like to token issuances like L1 I think salana is still the the leader you know whatever they despite their cringe advert and and and like the the crime season with with pump fun and all this uh I think they're still the leaders they're executing on a very high level they have a bunch of like narrative shots on goal there's like people working on payments on salana there's there's uh the salana phone there's like double zero uh built on salana there's a bunch of deepend projects and I like the idea of like these narrative shots on goal where like if any of these narratives takes off salana has another cycle another season in it right um and and so I'm still bullish on on on salana um and then on the exchange side like and and the cool thing about hyper liquid is that it straddles all three I think eventually like right now it's it's exchange plus L1 so it's sort of like salana um pump fun and like radium and drift in one in one product right so I think if you think the for exchanges like the everything exchange like binance is maybe like 50 to 100 billion and then you think the Tam for L ones is is another 50 to 100 billion um and then assuming I think at some point they'll do a stable coin which kind of makes sense every exchange does a does a stable coin right like bitfinex did tether binance had B USD before they got cucked by the by regulators and uh and uh coinbase has usdc and those are like the biggest exchanges in in the history of of crypto so I think they'll do a stable coin eventually that's another like 50 to 100 billion so it's just like straddles all three narratives um they're executing very well and and they have this like Immaculate Conception moment of the airdrop which is going to be really hard to recreate right like all these people that that uh was trading on this thing got rich on it are very loyal um there's no VCS and stuff to dump like all this this narrative is is is hard to recreate like even if you build a hyper liquid like product um you can't Fork the cap table uh and you you can't especially with this new token economics that they have where you know holding tokens gives you discounts I think it's like very in a very good position um and then the stable coins narrative yeah like I think Athena obviously is have been very vocal about about that one and we have uh we have like Venture bags of it so I'm obviously conflicted um but I'm I'm I'm I hold it's my biggest position in my in my PA as well right now um and I'm I just think like guys executing on such a high level and they're also trying to go after at least the The Exchange in L1 sorry the the L1 and stablecoin and then they have this like ethereal this building a decks on on on Athena and I think they're going to be able to have this like B&B like ecosystem where you're just having projects launch on Athena chain and distributing to to Ena holders um so those are kind of my my big bets and then I have like I have some other stuff in in smaller size that I'm that I'm bullish on I have some AI coins um I have Tia um yeah I have some fart coins still that I'm that I'm uh holding on to and then a bunch of a bunch of venture bets in the in the space that I'm interested I mean I still think AI is like the biggest narrative happening in the world like we could do a whole podcast on that like it's just I don't know if you're using it you kind of know right if if you know you know it's just going to collapse the marginal cost of Labor to like zero over time like initially mental labor um and and eventually like physical labor too with with robots right and it's just um yeah it's just progressing so so quickly um and I think it's like a unique yeah anyway we we don't have to go into a it's like a whole it's a whole thing but um that's probably the thing I'm spending the most time on huh I'm the exact same like it's a complete Rabbit Hole I I was saying to you before the we started the podcast like this is the first time in a long time I've actually had time to like research and build and just focus on what I used to do because the last like year has been so crazy in terms of um in terms of the market and one thing I've really been going deep into is like AI optimization yeah it's insane like testing all the new models trying it out for Content like clipping content tweeting llms this is like all super Baseline stuff and then it goes as far as I actually wrote a thread on humanoid robotics like it goes there and like the I don't see a single like vertical of human life that won't be um affected or or improved or however you want to you know contextualize it by AI so it's uh yeah if you're going to spend time doing anything like getting ahead of the curve in terms of AI in your daily life but also in your investment life is I think a pretty high uh like positive EV thing to do yeah it was sort of like a Bitcoin white paper moment for me uh Ai and I've uh I'm I'm probably like even more bullish on AI than I am on on on crypto at this point um and if you're in crypto pivot to AI yeah exactly um I mean I I still think like crypto has has such like macro Tailwinds and stuff it's it's it's tough but just AI I think is gonna just create like tens of trillions of dollars of value like um when at scale and there's going to be like so many opportunities I'm not sure exactly where they are yet I've been spending a lot of time kind of thinking about that and making a few Investments but yeah it's it's and and also like you said personal opportunities it's a hard personal opportunities is huge but in terms of investing it's such a hard I I find it's such a hard industry to invest in because obviously you've got some public publicly traded stocks like Tesla sure like I hold Tesla in my portfolio and some other stuff longer term um a lot of the opportunities are gated now I'm lucky like you to probably have access to some of these private Equity opportunities but even they are extremely risky because you're dealing with startups so it's kind of like I feel like investing in AI is complete spray and prey and I also feel like every other VC is spraying and praying so like I don't know if we're kind of doing a bit of an Internet bubble 2.0 just like investing in absolute garbage so it I find it's actually a hard sector to invest in long term just because it's so unclear like what ends up winning and even the products that are winning like chat GPT and Claude like these aren't even making money they're losing a lot of money but they're just fighting for mind share yeah no that's fair I mean I I I try and think about it as as like a stack like the the AI stack and you sort of have like at the bottom like hardware and um like the actual physical infrastructure to deploy that Hardware so you know stuff like data centers and like you know stocks like conol and things like this then on top of it you have models right um you know anthropic xai chat jpt um and and like in probably roughly at the same level in terms of how I think about you have like data like all the data that that goes into these to these models you have like scale Ai and and companies like that and a lot of startups working on that and then on top of that you have the applications right um and I think if you have it an I think it's worth having like some exposure to all three like to all three areas of the stack because it's hard to to say where value will ACR like a lot of people think models will be completely commoditized um and so value will just ACR at the hardware and application layer right I kind of disagree with that like if if you have a world of super intelligence where these things are generating like IP uh then the model companies are going to be like insanely valuable right they're going to have armies of of of super intelligent phds working on Innovations and the IP acrs to the to the company itself and then I also think the models end up like uh verticalized and building a lot of and like um verticalized to application so I chat PT is the best example they have the model and the application right they have 400 million weekly active users it's like insane it's like the biggest the fastest growth of any uh user base for any company ever is is chat GPT and then but even anthropic like I'm I was uh I still code with with like Vibe code with cursor or whatever but anthropic 3.7 like a lot of people ditched cursor and just code in in anthropic itself right um and and I think you're going to keep seeing that right there was like AI voice stuff then then chbt built voice mode and and all those startups are dead and so uh I think you have to have bets in all three and I'm really I really think there's going to be like a golden age of application Builders honestly where Venture completely changes like suddenly you don't need huge teams to tackle these problems you need like a couple so that two smart people two or three smart people can quit their jobs and work on this for 18 months and now they're just building like uh you know backends and uis on top of these models and making a margin on on the cost of inference and I I I think it's just going to be sort of like automating workflows that you try and do with these models but they're like hard and manual um and and automating them into applications and you can literally build them with one or or two people and just charge like 99% margins on the cost of inference you know and kind of kind of seeing this already with people like levels right these like uh superb builders that can just leverage AI to like 100x their their productivity now they can build games they can build all sorts of stuff there's other people like that that we've been speaking to but I almost think it creates a new model for Venture where like the big Venture funds are kind of cooked like because it's so hard to like with AI you just don't need as much money to do a lot of this stuff obviously there's still like the hard tech and Hardware stuff it's always going to need money but for for software things I just think um it changes the game a little bit and so there's a lot of opportunities I think to either do product Studios for this or invest in in in Founders that are going to build like seven to eight figure businesses on top of AI um and I think a lot of those will end up being tokenized because it's the best way for for these Founders to to get liquidity to unlock liquidity on on on the businesses they built um yeah that's what I was going to ask you I was actually going to ask you where you think the overlap will be with with crypto and AI um because like AI is like a very clear um vertical Bitcoin and and and crypto for like payments stable coins also very clear but how do they how do they truly intersect I think is what because we saw like agents run in January as a bit of a fad but like longer term and we we've seen like stable products like AIA you know with their compute come into the market and do well like long longer term where's where do you think the intersection will happen um yeah I think crypto AI has a lot of vaporware in it um and and and also a lot of like speculative infrastructure which is fine which is normal with every new new sector uh there there's a bunch of areas that I'm interested in like the overlap of I think like payments and like AI being able to use crypto uh and like um you know um NPC and like having like Sovereign AIS all this stuff is like interesting speculative um area um and then I do think like the idea of having these this like these composable compute Primitives so we predicted in our in our thesis last year like we wrote it I think in in like July or September or or August 2023 or something like that um just that we thought we're going to have a many model world and at the time chat PT was a dominant model was before deep seek and all of this and and that crypto thrives in this many model world because it's like you can you can combine these composable compute Primitives and build entirely new applications and you can leverage like open source models to to run stuff locally do Edge Computing um have like uncensored models all this stuff and I think all that will happen so I think like for better for worse one of crypto's killer apps is regulatory Arbitrage right like you can you can put things on This Global Ledger and they can't be stopped and so you you you you can like uh buypass sort of regulations that would otherwise that that that you would otherwise be under right like all these meme coins um launched to Global investor bases if you wanted to do that with Equity you you'd have to go through a bunch of regulations and stuff to do that um like stable coins themselves right have have and it's it's sort of how like Innovation happens and and I do think there's going to be regulatory Arbitrage in AI like clearly there's going to be people who want to who want to um access like uncensored models like there's there's a company we we backed like that's doing only fans but with digital twins so it's like these girls get like digital twins trained on their on all their only fans interactions and all their photos and stuff like this and you can basically scale yourself infinitely right so you can have like uh talk to in infinite amounts of people so there's like all these areas that it's gonna um permea to and I think crypto is going to be going to be useful there and then I do think just tokenization itself is going to be huge like you're already seeing a trend of this of like public uh of like uh successful sort of companies just seeing crypto tokens as uh the best way for them to like unlock some some liquidity like align incentives with their stakeholders like you see this with the centralized exchange tokens right B&B um and and I think you're going to see a lot of that in AI like basically kind of either AI Labs or companies Building Products that just issue a token token gets some cash flows or or like some some link with Burns or something like that to the network or to the to the product and I think especially in a in a world of Hester Pierce and stuff there's going to be good Frameworks to do this and I just think um I just think that's going to happen like people have made so much money uh like issuing to tokens in in in crypto that I think that cats sort of out of the bag and right now what we have is is an unfortunate thing with mcoins and stuff where there's a self- selection where only like mostly scammers and uh lowquality people want to issue tokens in crypto but I think with a friendly SEC and some good examples of of tokens launching that do real things uh we're just gonna have like a lot of really high quality projects wanting to launch tokens like centralized projects wanting to launch tokens it's a good way to bootstrap right like we even saw this I don't know if you've heard of the project uh limitus but it was some Oxford guys who who who created and they built like a desktop AI agent um but that's just one example of like you know these guys were very smart like phds but they um they didn't want to go down the traditional route like they did exactly what you were saying they just spent a year whilst they were studying like building a product and um and then like they launched a token to fund it to fund for Runway presumably um or just for awareness I think an interesting thing it's not just bootstrapping it's also like how much cultural impact and attention can you drive from a successful token launch and airdrop that you couldn't otherwise drive from like a traditional uh launch like you can drive a lot of awareness to your product so like is is launching in crypto doing a big air drop actually the way to bootstrap 50 to 100,000 users just to like find out about your product and then natural word of mouth if the product's good should theoretically get it off the ground so I think there's like a very valuable flywheel there as well that's I agree and companies just don't go public anymore like there's less IPOs than than than ever before and people still want access to these early stage opportunity so I I just think crypto succeeds just like a lot of it like just that alone is such a Tailwind for for crypto and altcoin altcoin season are there any specific AI like project or tokens or anything that that you guys have been investing in that that that come to mind um yeah the the none of it's very actionable because most of our like uh pretty much all our investments with Ventures have been in the private markets and only a few of them have tokens out but yeah we're investors in in Grass um we're investors in noose who's doing some of the coolest work in this space um and I think we've we've probably deployed like over 25 million to crypto crypto AI projects um at different different stages so there's a long list of names of stuff that were that we're pretty excited about like launching and and and building but not nothing too actionable I think for the for the listeners I've bought I mean I have some uh some some tokens on on private markets on public markets sorry but it it's definitely like a lower lower conviction uh play for me so I don't necessar want to want to share and get people yeah that makes sense what what vertical specifically in in AI do you think if you're a retail investor like what area would you look most into like is it the GPU players is it the agents is that like decentralized models what what sector would you look at within AI yeah it's tough I just I think the you would look for um like good teams honestly building in in any of these verticals um is is is how I would how I would kind of try and look at this and I don't know I try and think about like what the stack looks like and work backwards from what do you think it looks like at at like the end game so if you had to think about how crypto AI um or any of these sectors like AI looks like in in in three to four years what do you think it's going to look like and try and own like good teams building legit stuff and and and kind of any of those um I do think like robotics is super hyped it's gonna get a bunch of traction um you can kind of see what the hype narratives are but I just think uh again like I think playing the hype narrative game is really tough and it's it's not my game so I'm I'm I don't want to be advise people to to do that uh including Builders like a lot of Builders play the hype narratives game like you had Igan layer launch and how many sort of like avss did you see raising you know millions of dollars and they don't realize it takes you a year and a half a year to two years to launch by the time you launch the narrative is dead and you've just spent a year to two years building something you don't believe in because you you you thought there was some because you saw this market cap and you thought there was there was like um some some real value there and I really think the best way to do it is to build like the rational thing that makes sense or fundamental sense because especially if you're building but also if you're investing it's just an easier game to play like time Arbitrage is the best Advantage I think that retail investors have is that you don't have LPS that that force you to sell at some point you don't have like Max drow down limits you don't have um like uh timelines that you have to you have to return the fund by and so and and you don't have like social pressure right from LPS so I just think the best thing you can do is is really think about this long term uh I think crypto is is uh sometimes like people see it as a get-rich quick uh thing but I think it's really difficult to to play it that way um yeah I don't know I wouldn't recommend it so I would say like go go deep into AI like use all the products like use all the products in in centralized AI like play with it uh speak to teams like if you want to if you want to do this as a retail investor you have to like you you have to go the extra mile like you have to speak to these teams you have to have a thesis about where the space is going you have to read the thesis you have to like adjust on the Fly you have to find really good teams and and and back them like you it's it's you can't just read a Twitter thread and ape some some thing at at at whatever valuation and think you're going to make money like it's just not how how markets work um yeah I think that's good that's actually really good advice like something people don't do enough is is actually like Leverage how accessible the industry is like obviously I've built my brand and contacts and connections through content but there are so many other ways that you can do it like even just becoming a value ad to an existing product or Creator like there there are many people who were just you know in my Discord that were like amazing contributors and and now they're apprentices and sum be rolling out a product to give opportunities to them so like you can do that on a smaller scale as well you can you're bullish on AI like get into the Discord the mods and the founders like they're they're they're not as far away in crypto as like other Industries and a lot of the amas as well like on Twitter spaces you'd be surprised the amount of like leaks that that happen there like yeah you put the pieces together and you spend the time doing it you can actually like extract an advantage just purely off information for sure especially if you start building in like AI workflows like have have you know like I I can do I can keep up with so much more now with AI like just pulling transcripts and and of like these governance calls and of of whatever and just giving me the takeaways like having it all for all the projects in my portfolio like it's just so much easier to to to keep up with stuff with with AI so yeah I I really think you go to you got to grind like if you're if you're a retail investor if you're not willing to grind just hold Bitcoin you know just hold the majors uh like if you want a alpha you have to grind for it um and I I you can also hire prompters too like like one thing I think retail like if you're a bit if you're a richer retail like I know I've got some viewers that are willing to spend $1,000 a month let's say on on crypto like you can actually hire like two vas from the Philippines for like $500 a month each or $600 a month each and um I've seen like these professional prompters so you can basically say look this is my portfolio these are 10 coins like every time there's an AMA like prompt give me the summary give me the cliff notes like condense it all put it into like so you can you can actually build your own mini research team as a retail investor but I think people don't think of that they think okay I want to spend my $1,000 trading a meme but what if you spend $1,000 like building a workflow you know like what what could that lead to down the track it's an interesting exactly and building those tools speaking to Founders uh thinking about where the space is going like that stuff compounds like you you do that work once and you have a mental model that will get easier in future like you'll know better how to assess Founders in future if you build this tool you're going to learn to code you're going to probably run into some problem that you had while doing it and you see oh there's actually a product idea here and then either you go and build it or you see someone building it and you're like I know this is a problem because I use myself right whereas the time you spend looking at charts like reading you know Doom scrolling on on on Twitter like that stuff does not build any long-term value for you the compounds you know that that's sort of how I how I see it like have a portfolio that you're comfortable holding for for a while so that you can spend your time building long-term value for for yourself and in whatever way you think that that makes sense and if you are going to trade just limited I I I think trading could be fun I enjoy trading but like I think you've really got to limit it to like a percentage like 10 20% of your portfolio but you also need time limits because if you're spending 90% of your time like trading the 10% that also doesn't make sense yeah so I think yeah you have to like it down agreed yeah and like you're a really good example and there's so many there's like of someone that you you I'm pretty sure you didn't have a network in the space when you started right you just kind of grinded your way by by building writing threads about stuff like um interviewing people like just adding value right and you you grinded your way to to like being super successful in the in the media space and I think it's that's very doable in crypto it's one of the only Industries where you can really grind up as like retail and like within a few months you can be speaking to the top Founders in the space and adding because there's so few people that are willing to do that there's so few people that are willing to put in the work to do it which just just put and so few people are long-term oriented right it it just puts you in in a very select group and it's it's sort of like um the highest value thing you can do I think as as as retail honestly you know what I realized in in especially over the last year as I've gotten deeper into the space deeper into the marketing space there aren't that many quality K's like there are there's actually a lack of docks and I kind of understand it for a few reasons but there's a lack of quality doxed knowledgeable K's and I think it's because a lot of people that know a lot about crypto they are go and they work for a project they either go and they like work for a fund or maybe they don't even you know stay long enough or succeed long enough in the space to like get to that point or they just like don't understand how to play the content game so they never get views they're smart but they end up just kind of quitting the content thing but there's actually a lack of people that like converge the skill set of like being a decent content creator not even amazing but just decent and also know something about crypto and then like the chair on top is like being doxed and I think that's an intersection that like I've hit like all three of those points but like if if you're willing to also if you also have those two three thing those two three things if you also have all those three things like that's pretty much a recipe for Success if you give it like six months to a year like maybe maybe you won't get to 500k 600k followers a million followers but even 50k followers is an insane amount of Leverage in the space you're not only getting access to seed deals now but you're also getting access to sponsorships you're also getting access to interviewing Founders which can lead to like deal flow down the track like it's very achievable 100% and it's just like it looks intimidating at first like crypto does AI does but you got to realize these things are so early like there's there's they're no they're not that many experts like uh in crypto when we entered in 2017 like we there was cryptography experts there was distributed systems experts there was in like uh mechanism design experts but very few people combined all of them right so there's there's and it's it's the same sort of thing in AI now like 2022 was really the the mainstream moment for AI obviously there are people that have been building in it for for decades but that was the mainstream moment and the majority of people entered then and so they're like at maximum like two years ahead of you right like it's it's it's not that big a deal to try and if you see an opportunity like uh just just pursue it like grind use the stuff think about it and uh post publicly like you did whatever whatever your path is I think you're going to have a lot of cool opportunities there that's a way better use of your time than uh in my opinion than being in the trenches honestly like grinding Casa and and trying to like uh play these pump and dump games I think even coding on like cursor or like these AI like you know Vibe coding is like a bit of a thing it's it's become popular again because of these AI tools like um even doing that is probably like a a better use of time trying to trench which is that's something I'm going to be making more content on because I've doing it myself and and researching it so I think over the next few weeks even I'm going to start making some videos on like how people can actually actionably get started with it because I think that's like also a niche that not many creators are digging into even though like a lot of them are using it in their daily lives so I think I think that would be interesting agreed yeah all right I think I think we'll C it here because we're just under an hour and and I think we could do another hour of AI yeah now I'm realizing we um like we barely even talked about about crypto maybe let's just end it on like what's what's your what's your kind of Outlook this year like what do you um look I'm not not expecting crystal balls on price action but just in terms of like what's your general framework heading into the rest of the year in terms of how you're positioning how you're trading I'm I'm bullish uh I was bullish in in uh January too so so you know I'm I'm I'm like you know 30% down on bitcoin and and you know 50 plus perc down on else I'm even more bullish than I was on on select alt right like there's G to be a lot of dispersion but I think the the macro is like the the most annoying thing is just like the instability um and sort of not knowing like these these tariffs I think is tough because you know if this is a regime shift where you know there's just 30% tariffs going forward then that meaningfully changes like uh like global trade right because now uh you know the only way to avoid tars is to build in the US but building factories in the US is like a four to eighty year you know commitment so you need to know that that the tariffs are going to stay for that long because if you build a massive factory and then the tariffs go away and suddenly you have to compete with with Chinese labor again you've just like wasted the investment right and so you need to know not not only that they'll last through Trump but also that they last through the next like if if it's AOC in charge it's you're going to keep the tariffs right so that's the only thing that's like uh there's a bit of instability with with that and with Doge and things but I do think it's it's uh crypto always front runs things like it it pumps it dumps first and and it pumps first so I think if you're kind of getting bearish on tariffs like uh you know when when alts are down 80% it's it's it's sort of the wrong the wrong wrong thing um and yeah I'm I'm pretty bullish like you're gonna have obviously like uh I think an interest rate um easing cycle this year whether it's two cuts or three Cuts you're gonna have tax like 500 billion basically of of tax relief if Trump implements his his previous tax policies um and you're just going to have like deregulation you're GNA have like the stable coin Bill uh the US pursuing budget neutral ways to acquire Bitcoin I don't know what that looks like there's if you ask chpt that has some pretty interesting ideas on that on on what that could be um so I think overall we're in a we're in a good spot the there's just a lot of vapor Weare too that's going to go to zero and so you're GNA have to contend with that there's going to be like skitso Vibes on the timeline right some people that get absolutely wrecked and and and some people that are they're doing they're doing good um and then just AI I think is just going to keep driving like I don't know like even if I said tweeted this the other day but even if AI progress stopped right now I think you would have like 10 15 years to just Implement everything that exists so far across the economy and it would drive like like trillions to tens of trillions of value you know and the crazy thing is it's just it's accelerating right like the the new models are getting better quicker and you have the the biggest the biggest and most profitable companies in the history of the world spending every single dollar of free cash flow on making these models better um you know like literally 200 billion between Facebook Google and and and Microsoft being spent on on infrastructure this year so so I just think we're in for like a crazy few years of just insane acceleration AI permeating through every layer of the economy uh like permanent structurally higher unemployment because a bunch of people just won't be able to add value above the cost of inference right like how you gonna as a junior lawyer compete with with an AI model that can that can read every single uh like um sort of relevant case in so so what actually yeah what actually happened with when that I've gone through this thought process as well like in 10 years like what actually happens when pretty much like 80% of the workforces like redundant essentially like does the government just have to like tax even more and just like pay out benefits like does it become super like socialist to like just try and like you know have welfare to support these people does everyone just become like a prompter does the yeah I mean it kind of feels like the rich get a lot richer because they actually have access to invest in this technology and business becomes more efficient but then the wealth disparity just increases exponentially I think the rich do get richer I think the skilled get like insanely higher leverage like if you're because AI will and the more I Vibe code and spend time with a the more I think that there's always going to be a human in the mix like there's there's going to be a prompter someone that's uh telling the AI what to what to uh what solution to to what what solutions to try like with VI coding it that happens a lot um and and those people like everyone's going to have to be an entrepreneur basically prompting a bunch of AI models to to do stuff for them um and the people who are who are good at that who are good entrepreneurs who have good judgment who have good taste are going to be like 100 to a thousand X more efficient like you're gonna have these billion dollar onep person companies like all the things we we discussed but at the same time there's a bunch of people who are who just like for whatever reason weren't as ambitious or weren't trained for this kind of world they were expecting to just be able to do the same job for for for 20 years and just provide for their family and and have a chill life and those people are going to really struggle to add value beyond the the cost of compute I think humans always like we've said this for every technological revolution in the past and we've always been wrong there have always been new jobs created right I think there's going to be some of that but I think in this one there's actually going to be some legit like structural this feels different to me but but it kind of goes against exactly what you said like every every time is different but this actually feels different but we haven't been through the old like ra like exactly it does feel different I don't know don't know what to tell you I mean I think humans there's always going to be jobs that you prefer Humanity to efficiency right like probably like Artisan I don't know like this desk I had a a woodworker make like I I I probably would I like having the relationship with him uh he's he's really good at his job I'm probably G to want to have that um art like sports right like uh you're probably not going to want want to watch like AI play football with each other right you're going to want to watch humans um Esports like there there's all these things that I think you prefer or like psychologists like personal trainers I think there's there's things that you'll prefer there'll be some bonus for Humanity um and then I think the the other side is is like uh the prompters right there's going to be so many jobs and like education is going to have to change completely to train people for this new world where you where you have uh where you have the possibilities of AI like it's just and and so I do think there's going to be like some structural unemployment and you're G to have to have some form of of socialism of like Ubi to take care of of all these people um but the thing is you're gonna have like insane abundance right if this plays out you have like super intelligent coming up with yeah coming up with like new ways to get like zero cost energy or or to get um like cures to cancer um like like synthetic uh like foods that are super healthy like you're going to have abundance like you're the the government should and like you have to do some maths on it but the government should be able to kind of take care and provide like minimal uh minimal viable life right for all its citizens like whether it's like a mixture of food stamps and health stamps and education stamps so that everyone can like no one's dying of hunger no one's going uneducated no one's homeless and then you just have like uh uh that's the this this and then you just have people able to like get educated and start doing AI art or building businesses with AI do doing this kind of stuff it's it's in a way it's like the most Level Playing Field ever with AI right like uh because the the cost is so low to to get access to capabilities that that you would have had to hire a whole Workforce for before um so that's my bull case is like I'm what about neuralink like people literally have this information in their brains and that that's like ultimate um leveling of the playing fields right when everyone literally just has access to un like I think that's theate for for humans right it's like this Android like I tell my girlfriend that I I I already would love to have that because it's sort of like a I'm like input constrained like sometimes I'm I just want to say I want to ask something to Ai and I have to type it out and it takes me 30 seconds and I I'm like I want to do it instantly you know like Channel it from my brain so I you think that's going to be uh like this Android future is is the most or like synthesis right the synthesis of the biological and the artificial is like kind of the best end game we can hope for um because if it's not that it there's some worst things right where we just get dominated but I think synthesis is is both the most likely and the most bullish um yeah we actually invested in neuralink recently like we did a secondary for it just because we're we yeah kind of think that's the endgame ux it's not that far off like it's they're already starting like test soon like it's really not that far off like obviously it's not end game but like they're pretty down the track of like basic functionality like being able to control computer with your eyes and being able to like have basic stuff like that it's insane to me it's insane yeah it's it's insane like this podcast I could theoretically already this isn't even in 10 years right now it's possible that I can like make the screen go away and then bring us back and like Go full screen and do this just all from like my eyes controlling the yeah in the future I don't even know if you listen to to podcasts like I don't know like there's this world where like I'm I'm like for instance uh one thing I did the other day was like I pulled the transcripts for all my favorite podcasts I put them into a a markdown file I asked AI to like summarize the takeaways and then I put that into notebook llm and generated a podcast from it so I basically had this like meta podcast of all the takeaways from all my podcasts you know so it's like I don't know the the the more that's actually Alpha that's actually Alpha for crypto people I think like I mentioned before getting vas to do that but if if you basically had um all the projects that you hold in your portfolio right because the really annoying thing is keeping up to date with everything so if you could have an AI that just like summarizes in like audio form one minute per week all the upates you to to all of yours like that would be literally I'm actually building that right now with with uh with AI like I'm Vibe coding a v one of this so once I have it I'll send it to you see if it's see if it's useful to you but it's literally exactly what I'm trying to build 100% that's that's cool that's very cool yeah you should definitely build that and then send it to me and uh and I'll I'll test it out we'll do man would you ever launch one of these products publicly like if you Vibe coded something that you thought was like really sick and then like you could build it into like a much bigger thing would you ever do that like I think I actually I think I will do it with this one I think I'm gonna like build it in public uh and sort of go through like the vibe coding Journey with it and like keep people updated on on on what I'm doing and then launch it like I don't know if I have the uh hunger to like win with the product like this you know you need a lot of like winning is is hard in in product in an a especially but I I definitely want to launch it and see mostly BD like it's just an insane amount of marketing and brand positioning it's yeah yeah it's a different story building stuff's cool that's like what Andre CR always talks about like you know he loves building but like the actual marketing of a product is like not the fun part like building is the fun part I actually enjoy enjoy distribution and marketing uh it's uh I find that a lot of fun too but yeah we'll see I I'll release it I'll probably be able to have a view on by next week with I'm building it with a friend who's a who's a really dope Vibe coder so let let's see okay I'll send it to you nice nice all right bro thanks for thanks for hanging out much you too we'll have you on we'll have you on soon we'll talk about crypto next time Absolut let do it I'm kidding you guys later"
