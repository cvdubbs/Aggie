    "transcript": " this is absolutely wild and is by far the craziest thing that I've ever seen in my 6 years in crypto since my video yesterday which covered the Trump meme coin prices have over 4X and Trump just keeps going higher and higher and higher since the initial launch it's run up from just a few cents all the way up to $72 making it one of the highest valued projects in all of cryptocurrency and a lot of people are asking how much further can this Trump run go so that is something I'm going to be discussing in today's video I also want to talk about some of the knock on effects for the crypto Market because although Trump is pumping you do have to start to look forward to think about what could the other beneficiaries be of this pump clearly salana has been a major beneficiary but I think we're about to see a big rotation into a sector of alt coins which I'm going to discuss today and then I'm also going to discuss how I think it affects the market from a fundamental Dynamics perspective because there are very very very bullish effects that this Trump launch is going to have on the market but there are also some bearish or more negative effects that the Trump mcoin launch could have on the market so I want to take a look at both of the pros and the cons to try and evaluate how this has changed the fabric of crypto spoiler alert it's changed things quite a lot so if you do enjoy content like this right keep you up to date with the latest Alpha in cryptocurrency make sure you do click the Subscribe button down below and hit that post notification Bell so you don't miss a single video you're going to want to be keeping up to date with the crypto Market over the next couple of weeks because it's going to be absolutely crazy we have Trump's an auration tomorrow over the next few days I'm sure we're going to see him speaking about cryptocurrency a lot more that's going to cause a lot of Market volatility then we have fomc on the 29th where the fed's interest decision is going to come in and then uh we enter the month of February which is historically one of crypto's strongest performing months especially in Bull markets and all of this craziness is likely to continue to unfold so it's really time to lock in I know a lot of you are probably feeling a little bit tired or just confused or just like flabbergasted by what's occurred but you really need to get serious and lock in because the rotations are only going to become more violent the market reactions to every move are only going to become more violent as the cycle progresses and it does feel like we're reaching a little bit of a climax here which obviously creates a lot of opportunity but it means you need to be hyper Vigilant hyper adaptive and uh yeah every single day we're going to keep uh keep covering the latest stuff in the market and the latest opportunities and there definitely are a lot of opportunities at the moment that I think are going to come from this Trump pump even if you missed the pump I know there's this temptation to feel like you've missed out like Squidward as you can see in front of you but even if you did miss the trade like even myself I did not really capitalize on the Trump trade even though I was up when it launched at least a few hours after I could have bought at like six bill I had another chance at 11 bill I didn't really go in with any size because it just didn't really fit my investing framework and that's fine uh but where my head is mostly at are what are the opportunities that come on as a knock on effect from this because it is introducing new liquidity into the market I mean moonshop became the number one app in the app store again so there's clearly a lot of new retail coming back in my brain is Shifting to okay what's next and I'm definitely happy for the all the people that made money on Trump some of my closest friends made millions of dollars on the Trump trade they were a bit luckier than me because they're in America so they got in a lot cheaper and I'm really happy for them and I'm happy for the opportunities that this might create in the market so if you did miss out on the Trump trade itself I don't think there's any reason to be jealous or salty I think there are opportunities in crypto all the time like how many trades have there been over the last couple of years especially over the last 12 months there's been so many meme queens that of 10 20 30X done even crazier things than the trumpcoin I think the difference is this was just such a public Affair this was such a crazy moment for crypto having the president soon to be of the United States launching a meme coin that it created a lot of noise and thus it creates a lot of fomo so what's happening with the Trump coin now let's start off there you can see it's sitting at around a $60 billion fdv which makes it one of the top cryptocurrencies by market cap actually in terms of fully diluted valuation it just flipped Dogecoin to become the biggest meme in crypto which has an fdv of 54 billion so this is pretty insane Trump now reaching uh top five territory in terms of ftvs and obviously the next targets are salana xrp and ethereum is there a world where Trump could potentially become the number two token in crypto after Bitcoin or the number three token after ethereum well we'll discuss that slightly later when we get into the salana discussion but it's definitely a question people are are starting to ask at the moment and as Evan says here it's probably the most absurd 24 hours in crypto history you've had just to recap ethereum go down salana pump massively a lot of the onchain alts their liquidity got drained right because what is happening is a lot of people are trying to chase the Trump pump now although there is some new capital coming into crypto it is a weekend which slightly limits people's ability due to banking restrictions and just you know convenience to actually put new money into crypto so what we're seeing a lot of at the moment is just rotating so no wonder if you look at your portfolio and you're saying you know wow there are some MIM coins that are down in there or wow there are some AI coins which are down in there no wonder I mean how else are people going to fund their buys into the Trump token they have to sell their onchain altcoins and use that liquidity to buy Trump so we're seeing a lot of rotary Capital go into like this liquidity Vortex and Trump's basically like sweeping up the entire altcoin market now there is a reverse effect which can be just as potent and Powerful of when Trump hits its peak and liquidity starts siphoning back into the Old Market that's definitely something that I expect to happen which we're going to discuss in a couple of minutes here but until then you just have to be a little bit patient because you need the Trump trade to play out first udy says here reading the timeline and most of you still don't get it crypto changed forever last night we're entering a period the likes of which has never been seen before anything goes bigger than the 2017 Ico bubble I don't care if you're happy about it or not it's happening adapt now basically to summarize everything what we got is the president of the United States giving crypto the green light in the most insane fashion launching his own meme this is only going to lead to more Pro crypto policy in the US and this green light I think is is a real turning point for crypto considering the last four years under you know the Democratic party and Gary gendler have basically seen this regime against crypto so the the script is being completely flipped on its head and now we're entering this Pro crypto policy era for the next four years which has massive ramifications in my opinion specifically for a lot of alts which are really sensitive to these issues like rwa like defi these are going to be big beneficiaries in 2025 and Beyond also it's introducing crypto on the widest scale ever it's giving crypto more mainstream media attention it's going to put a real focal point on crypto as an industry and the marketing as a whole for the industry is going to be bigger than ever so there's definitely some really bullish arguments to be made right now that this is basically pushing crypto into the stratosphere to levels that we've never really seen before and uh although I agree with that 100% And I think there's going to be lots of opportunities from that I also want to take some time just to evaluate all the pros and all the cons right now with you because I think it's important to have a nuanced take on the market so yes I agree with what OSF is saying here that this is a paradigm shift we've never seen before and you have to recalibrate your ceilings a lot higher I do agree with that but at the same time there are some Dynamics which are shifting so let's run through the pros and the cons and then we'll get into the most obvious beneficiaries and then later in the show how I'm actually playing it in terms of altcoin positioning to look at some of the rotations that are going to happen out of this Trump trade so the pros are one it's bullish for salana this is clear Souls had a massive run off the back of the news that the Trump token was launching on soul and it's basically being chosen as America's chain so a lot of the liquidity right now is going on to salana through moonshot for people signing up for new accounts a lot of the attention is back on salana and clearly it's bullish for soul and on the contrary which we'll discuss in a minute it's bearish for eth because Soul's the main competitor of ethereum and ethereum already was exhibiting relative weakness secondly it solidifies Trump's Pro crypto position as we discussed it's basically a green light on the biggest stage I think it also increases the odds of a strategic Bitcoin Reserve if you look at the odds on poly Market the market is starting to adjust to this Theory as well the odds were 27% a day ago it's now back up to 40 plus% so although it's not guaranteed the market thinks okay well if Trump's going to lach a meme if he's crazy enough to do that he could be crazy enough to do a Bitcoin strategic Reserve as well and pro crypto policy becomes maybe a bit more likely and that's that also has huge knock on effects for the regulatory environment specifically altcoins from rwa defi Etc which are probably the most impacted by legislation but obviously a Bitcoin strategic Reserve would send Bitcoin much higher which is good for the crypto market and sentiment overall the fourth bullish thing that the Trump launch has done is it's accelerated the net new inflows now I actually don't think we're really going to see the full impact of this until Monday or Tuesday because that's when banking opens up I know you've got Apple pay and things like that but a lot of players that weren't really uh banking over the weekend are now going to be able to on Monday it's also going to lead to more mainstream media coverage on CNN Etc especially as Trump gets inaugurated he might even mention this which is going to get more mainstream media attention and is going to only accelerate new net inflows into the a trump token and B crypto in general that's why I think if you're fading Trump and trying to short it it becomes a pretty dangerous game because there could still be inflows to come now I know a lot of people are front running this by buying up on the weekend so there could be like a uh an early push on Monday followed by a dump because a lot of people are taking profits on this trade it's going to be interesting to see how that plays out but a lot of people will at least be aware of it next week and it's going to lead to more net new inflows and I think what this does is it opens up the door especially for coins on the salana ecosystem to perform quite well as you have more liquidity in the Eco but I'm going to discuss that in a bit more depth in a couple of minutes cuz there is Nuance there and the other thing it does the final Pro that I have on this list is it opens up the door for more launchers in the US more Innovation I mean if Trump can launch a meme anyone can launch a coin in the US right so I do think this is a bullish thing overall for crypto in America maybe a lot of businesses as well that were on the sidelines funds that were on the Sidelines and not willing to embrace crypto maybe now that they'll actually fomo in or finally decide to take a position because it's very clear now that the administration is embracing it and it's basically as I said the green light whereas if Trump hadn't launched the meme and if he came out on Monday or Tuesday and didn't really speak about crypto I think the market would have tanked or or performed quite negatively because it would start to assume that a lot of the promises he made were false but on the contrary now we're getting confirmation essentially that a lot of the promises he made even if he's not able to do them at least he's serious about doing them and he's serious about crypto at least that's what he's broadcasting to the world and ultimately I do view that as the most positive thing for the market now before we get into the beneficiaries and how I'm trading it let's talk about some of the cons because there are some cons this isn't just a bullish thing I have heard a lot of people coming out and saying how crazy bullish it is and how it's going to send all our bags flying and although that could be true in the short term there is some negative effect of this in my opinion the first one is clear and it's already happening and you're probably already feeling it in your portfolio and I'm feeling it in mine as well it's the liquidity sock so if you're holding any other alt pretty much apart from salana Trump Bitcoin or fcoin or maybe a couple of AI coins that's rebounded really strongly today you're probably feeling the pain a little bit rwa also held up pretty well most of the rwa coins are actually up and the defi coins are up but apart from that anything on chain whether it be AI memes pretty much any onchain play has been drained because Trump continues to suck liquidity and the truth is this won't really change you won't see the liquidity flow back into the other alts until Trump puts in a top so if you're asking when is this rotation going to happen it's going to happen whenever Trump puts in a top and I don't know when that's going to be maybe it's on Monday right maybe that's it and we see the sell off and then the trade's over or maybe it's later in the week or maybe it's in a couple of weeks we don't know right now you just have to remain adaptive so in the meantime and we'll speak about this later as to what I'm doing and which coins but DCA into some of the onchain plays which are being hit in my opinion I think that's a good idea and that's something that I'm doing for when that liquidity suck eventually disperses back into the market because there is net new inflows coming from this the problem is in the interim other altcoins are experiencing a liquidity drain so that is clearly a bad thing for crypto and it has stalled a lot of the altcoin market I I don't think it's a bad thing forever it's just a bad thing in the very very short term I'm talking days here the second thing is and this is kind of contrary to the green light Theory but could it make this is a question could it make the Endeavors of the Trump Administration slightly more difficult because he looks bad in front of Congress that's a question I have will a Bitcoin strategic Reserve be impeded by him launching a meme will this invite additional scrutiny it may be the case it may be the case the third point on the bearish side it incentivizes more meme launchers which because if Trump can do it right the president of the US anyone can do it so will you see more celebrities public figures seeing how much money Trump has made from this by the way they've cashed out around 500 million according to the sources that I checked which is I mean a lot of money right um now we don't know what exactly they're going to use it for they could use it to inject back into the token they could do an air drop we don't know what they're going to do with that additional Supply but um we know that on paper they've made a lot of money so is this going to incentivize more of these launches I personally think so which becomes a bullish thing in the short term right because there's going to be more excitement around crypto more people getting into crypto more people you know being on boarded downloading wallets more new liquidity on the bullish side but on the bearish side it's going to also cause more dilution more tokens equals more dilution which makes it even harder to just buy and hold it really becomes more of a Traders Market if that's going to be the trend and I think it pushes the market Direction further towards this trend of launching new tokens with how what Trump has just validated essentially now the other thing I've done and this is very very important we'll probably discuss it more tomorrow the day after but I want to make the point in today's video still I think this accelerates the cycle so previously I thought maybe we had a 20 to 30% chance of topping in q1 that was my framework I think the Trump launch increases the odds of us topping for the year in q1 probably to around 50 to 60% that's my feeling right now it's around 50/50 if we don't top in q1 I think what happens is we get a summer lull and then we top later in the year Q3 Q4 that's definitely on the table but what has become even more on the table over the last few days is an accelerated cycle where we see a top even sooner why because tops tend to happen around Peak Euphoria and Peak volatility what are we getting now we're getting maybe not euphoria yet but a lot of volatility which could lead to Euphoria so I'm just on the lookout now and I don't think it's I don't think we're toing in the next week or so necessarily but I'm on the lookout over the next 2 and a half months now that's how long q1 has left for some top signals now remember the most aggressive phase of the market is this last period so this could be a glorious period for altcoin holders and we'll discuss how I think liquidity is going to flow in a minute which basically summarizes I think why it could be glorious period for allcoin holders however just keep in mind in the back of your head there may be a 50% chance that we do see a local top or maybe even a cycle top within the next couple of months and uh for that reason I think you can view this Trump thing as a bullish thing or a bearish thing but it's bearish in the sense that it accelerated the cycle if you had another framework of course these things are adaptive right you may have thought the cycle had a 20% chance of topping in q1 a few weeks ago now it might have a 50% chance this changes right based on what Trump comes out and says that will also change my percentages but it's a rolling thing that's constantly adjusting and I think it's increased the percentage likelihood slightly in my opinion materially that doesn't change too much about how I'm approaching the market I'll discuss the alts today that I'm looking at accumulating I'll also discuss my strategy on those alts I think what it changes the most is I Am shifting a little bit away from just holding a bunch of alts into having a much smaller portfolio of long-term holds and then a bigger portfolio of Trades so there might be periods where I'm mostly long but I have the idea of an exit window at some point as opposed to just like holding a portfolio with like a super super super long-term time Horizon that's probably the only thing that it's materially changed in how I'm trading and then the final con is for ethereum holders it's bearish ethereum in my opinion because salana is its main competitor and you're basically seeing Trump endorsing salana in a roundabout way as America's chain of choice in a way and for ethereum this is bad because you've already seen capitulation amongst eth holders but even more holders are capitulating now swapping into Soul the highest Soul goes the more they'll want to capitulate the higher the likelihood of s flipping eth becomes and uh that that's pretty difficult momentum to try and slow down if you're an ethereum holder so at the start of the year in my predictions I made a prediction in my predictions video that I thought ethereum was going to come back at some point this year that if it does happen is significantly delayed in my opinion I think for the coming weeks and months um salana should continue to maintain its lead because in the short term this was very bullish sh and bearish eth so this is kind of the mental framework that I'm operating under right now now there's a question how high could Trump go now this is a very hard one to answer because it really depends on what Trump does if he comes out and says he's doing a Strate strategic Trump reserve and not a strategic Bitcoin Reserve well then you see Bitcoin dropping and Trump pumping even more and Trump would probably go insane now I don't think he's actually going to be able to do this but I don't know what his plans are I really don't and I don't know how much he plans on hyping this up so the more he Hypes it up the higher likelihood it has I mean it's probably what ranks six now in terms of fdv of jumping maybe into the fifth or the fourth or the third spot but it is going to become challenging as it keeps climbing to maintain this momentum because you got to remember there are a lot of early holders especially crypto people that have been accumulating on the weekend and even on Friday night in America that are now going to look to start offloading and that a lot of them probably already have on the way up but especially as it climbs up there'll be some heavy resistance I think starting to kick in and um the only way to break that resistance is for Trump to come out and uh go super bullish on on Trump and announce crazy stuff like strategic Trump reserves but I don't think that's happening for that reason I don't think the risk SC here is that great to be spot buying it I think there's definitely trades to be taken on Trump that's something I said yesterday like even though I'm not personally going in with size on spot very open to trading it because it has momentum um I kind of faded this one I kind of mid curved it personally in yesterday's video I said I wasn't taking a position but I understand why you would and I think it's actually going higher even though I'm not taking a position which kind of had me questioning my framework because if I thought it was going higher then why didn't I take a position I guess it just comes down to conviction but anyone that did obviously has made a lot of money and uh you can definitely look to start locking some profits in my opinion especially heading into Monday then will really know where the directionality of this goes but I don't think a $1,000 Trump and I put that in the thumbnail as a reference point because I'm seeing a lot of people talking about $1,000 Trump I don't think that's in my playbook for right now but Trump launching a meme coin two days before his inauguration wasn't in my playbook either so who knows now very important uh discussion now very very important I want to take a look at what could happen once Trump puts in a top because we're seeing liquidity be sucked into the Trump Vortex right now so people are selling their memes they're selling their AI bags on the salant blockchain because they want to buy Trump and they want to play the Trump trade but what happens once they start taking profits on Trump and going back into the market well the first thing that happens is soul does really well and Soul's already seen the effects of this Soul's pumping and doing really well um you can see my tweets here from the bare Market when I was accumulating Soul this has been one of my best performers I actually incidentally have a huge long on Soul right now I didn't plan on being this long soul but I had lots of AI coins that when I trade I trade them back into Soul so I found myself sitting on a bunch of soul in my wallet and this has repriced higher really quickly so I've been accidentally really really long Soul recently I haven't actually taken profits on it cuz I honestly think it could keep going higher so uh I continue to be long Soul not only from the bare Market but even from quite recently at around $20 to $220 so that's obviously amazing but that's just phase two phase four and you'll see here I've kind of made a bit of a joke on my Twitter I've crossed out the phase three and I've just had this rotation going straight to phase four because what I think is going to happen is as people take profits on Trump it's going to go into soul and then they're pretty quickly going to rotate into alts specifically the ones on the soul blockchain a lot of the AI stuff rwa stuff I actually did a Discord post about this I think uh leading memes on on the Sol Eco leading AI plays on solco leading rwa players on the Sol Eco these are some of the coins that people are going to rotate into so I think there's going to be a wealth effect when Trump puts in its local top that goes into soul and then eventually into alts especially on the soul Ecco which is one of my main focuses you'll if you know the original graphic it has phase one Bitcoin Phase 2 ethereum phase three large caps phase 3 old phase 4 old season but this cycle is completely different we're not seeing Phase 1 Bitcoin into ethereum that rotation hasn't happened the whole cycle but we are seeing Trump into Soul potentially into altcoins so this is kind of a framework that I'm playing off right now I don't necessarily think it's the Bible I don't think you should stick to it just like you shouldn't exactly stick to that other Bitcoin ethereum large cups old season Playbook because it's outdated but I think in this environment this is roughly how I'm thinking I think it's it's going to be very good for altcoins once Trump puts in a top but for now you just have to be a little bit patient that's where I think there's a window of opportunity to actually accumulate some of the strongest stuff uh fundamentally on SOL and we're going to discuss some of that later in the video I'll also keep you up to date in the miles high club with the latest plays that I add because there are a few trades that I'm doing right now so if you want the latest updates in real time make sure you sign up for the miles high club with a link in the description below that is my uh private Community where I post a lot of early Alpha and we also have other amazing analysts like paradise who's our head low time frame Trader doc on the high time frame stuff Fabian on the small cap stuff especially if the market starts to ramp up and really accelerate like I think it's what happening right now there's going to be so many trading opportunities so make sure you on the Discord for those opportunities actually in 30 minutes after recording this video I have an AMA where I'm going to discuss uh some of the plays that are making and answer questions which is going to be really cool I do that every Sunday with the audience which is a lot of fun so talking about phase two for a second how high could salana go I think that's a question a lot of people are asking right now because for soul to flip the ethereum market cap it has to do a 2.8x and that would be an $800 Soul there is momentum right now I think for this to be a realistic scenario it's always sounded kind of crazy but the probabilities just keep increasing that sa actually could flip eth because eth is bleeding and Soul's pumping so this is something to keep your eye on what does the soul eth chart look like because right now it's going parabolic could Soul kit 780 and E alltime high would have solid a $1,100 soul I think it's plausible it's a bit outlandish and it's not my base case but I think it is plausible in that environment if Soul keeps running obviously the rotation into SS would be even more insane it would be absolutely insane so actually even if you're sidelined on salana having salana run is actually quite a bullish thing and in a way having Trump run as long as there is a cap a ceiling on it it's also a bullish thing the most bearish scenario would be if Trump just keeps running and running and running and running and running and just keeps going up and there's never a rotation which I don't think is going to happen there's always a rotation and even with the old old season framework there were times where Bitcoin would outperform but it would always eventually rotate into alts and I think you're going to see a similar thing with Trump and salana and remember the higher Trump goes the more people you're going to on board into crypto we're already seeing this as you can see Mo shop became the number one app on the app store in the US which is absolutely insane so this makes it one of if not the biggest retail on boarding events of the cycle I can't remember a retail onboarding event of this scale since maybe Doge in 2021 this is a very very similar moment for crypto now the Doge trade interestingly ended up not marking the top for the market cuz there was a 2-e period where it did rotate into TS but there was eventually that summer lull and then that run up in the end of the year here I don't think that's going to happen again because timing wise it's a little bit different we're seeing this run in January that do run was in Q2 heading into Q3 and we know the summer periods are typically very choppy for markets and then we saw the the secondary run later in the year now there is a chance we have a cool off and then a run later in the year but there's a framework now that we hit this acceleratory phase in q1 and I think that changes the Dynamics a little bit and means that the rotation could have slightly longer to run than what happened with Doge into alss which was a really quick rotation it was violent but it was quick and then we ended up retracing I think this will last a little bit longer but the similar effect that it's going to have is bringing a lot of new liquidity into crypto however you have to keep in mind in the short term once again a lot of existing liquidity in crypto is also going into Trump which is why you see alt having the adverse reaction right now which I think at some point it'll flip uh new money is always good for the market in general especially if you're in the right coins but that rotation as I said only really happens once Trump puts in its top now there's an interesting bit of alpha here that game of one that game for one points out he says with Trump bringing in so much attention from normies and moonshot skyrocketing up the charts think it's worth paying attention and seeing what the normies are interested in this reminds me of monitoring coin Bay spot volume worth watching closely us rotation going on following Trump uses moved on to USA few others here stand out probably better bets than random Farms being launched on pump at the moment so what he's saying is look at moonshot there's actually a June analytics dashboard which shows you the top traded tokens on moonot if people are aping Trump on moonot look at the other stuff that's performing on moonshot cuz this is some of the other stuff that they might ape so a little bit of alpha for you is in your own time even download the moonshot app or simply use the June analytics dashboard and look at the tokens that are getting a lot of volume on moonshop because these could be the on that are next to run I also have another trade idea for you before we get into my bigger positional bet stuff later in today's video and that is some of the meme coins on salana so that a lot of them are bleeding as liquidity is rotating into Trump but I think tokens like whiff and bonk specifically whiff where I think the risk reward here looks pretty solid I think you could see a rotation back into some of the strongest memes on salul so with because you have clear inv validation as a trade I actually don't mind this one I was considering taking it myself because you've got clear invalid around a130 I still wouldn't lever up here this is mostly a spot trade but even mean reversion back to 220 is a quick 60% uh profit zone so this is an interesting one I think looking at forecasting where money could rotate after the soul/ Trump run starts to stall out a little bit so we're going to discuss that in a bit more depth in a minute firstly I want to discuss strategy so strategy for approaching the market and then we'll get into some of the the rotations and uh how I'm what I'm actually dcing into right before I think Capital rotates back game for one has a tweet here this is one of the more surprising events in crypto that I've experienced I was bullish in q1 but seeing some people now claim they knew so would be the sand out since December feels a bit off just two weeks ago things looked uncertain a week ago they seem promising and now here we are it's a reminder that nothing is truly predictable most of the time we're simply reacting 100% true I love this tweet here I think it's probably okay if your thesis for the short medium and long-term Outlook of the market isn't absolutely spot on a day after the president of the United States either got hacked or launched a meme this was obviously done straight after but it can be extrapolated to where we're sitting now basically saying look if you had a framework three weeks ago and you've been wrong I mean who can blame you who thought Trump was going to launch a meme this was not on the Playbook if this had never happened which would have been 99.9% chance if you asked me a week ago is Trump going to launch me and say no 99% chance he doesn't SS on chain never took a beating AI continues running they become rwa defi become the proxy bets for the Trump inauguration and the Market's in a very different place this has thrown everything off so you have to constantly reassess your strategy now it could be a much more bullish thing down the track but right now it definitely has materially changed the Dynamics of the market so why wouldn't you change and adapt as things are happening game for one says here the past 48 hours have been about being agile and aggressive to Sease opportunities for example when the Trump you know token launch to seize that opportunity quickly I didn't do it but if I was if I had a bit more agility or conviction at the time then uh that was a good opportunity those who adapted quickly likely outperformed those who positioned early and now suggest they always knew the outcome was inevitable the point I'm trying to get to here is be adaptive in this phase of the market if we really are reaching the eighth or ninth inning of the market now is the time you have to be really adaptive and not as glued to your thesis all the time if you're constantly glued to Old opinions and not willing to let new information impact how you're trading you're probably going to underperform so this is it is tricky if you're not really crypto native or if you're not on the pulse with the latest updates in the market it is really tricky because things are changing so quickly but if that's you then just hold coins you know hold a smaller portfolio of stuff we know is going to be a longer term beneficiary and don't try to play too many rotations either you do one or the other so I think rwa is a major beneficiary I don't think AI is going away look for the top tokens on salana in these niches they're going to do really really well irrespective of how quickly you can adapt to the market um if not you I think having more of a trading Focus this year is really going to benefit you and even for me I'm really reassessing my portfolio at the moment you you can see um crypto God John tweets here might be time to Nuke all the underperformers and start from scratch although I don't think being rash is the right approach there is validity in this comment and it's basically start from scratch on your portfolio Construction in the sense of don't just hold on to your current bags really reassess things look at the trends look at where liquidity and attention is flowing and really ask yourself if there's a bunch of normies coming back into crypto where are they going to put their money what stuff are they going to speculate on what do they find interesting what do they find funny what chains are they going to be betting on ask yourself these questions then once you've asked yourself those questions look at your portfolio and then ask yourself does my portfolio match those questions so if you think they're going to bet on salana and they're going to bet on AI and you look at your portfolio and you're in a bunch of ethereum meme coins there's a bit of a misalignment what you believe isn't actually what you hold and vice versa so just make sure that your portfolio is aligned to what is really going to happen in the market and what you believe is going to happen in the market if you think rwa is going to be the biggest beneficiary of these new regulatory changes but you're all in memes right now and you've barely got any rwa exposure that doesn't make sense so you really I think right now have to readjust and be pretty agile and act quick to readjust because this is going to be a crazy period of the market and you want to make sure your portfolio is in the right places now a lot of the recent content I've made I I haven't changed my opinion AI I still think we're going to discuss it in a minute here one of the best sectors to DCA into right now cuz it's not going away AI is massive right um iwa I've spoken about it for a long time years in fact but especially over the last week I did a video the other day on it I think it's going to be a big beneficiary in fact if you look at rwa coins they're barely down a lot of them are up on is up mantra's up checks is actually up like and that's on salana so people aren't selling their checks to buy Trump people are selling maybe their whiff to buy Trump or some of their other alts AI alts to buy Trump but they they're not selling checks because it's also a beneficiary of trump coming in so you just have to have that stuff in mind and I think uh now's the perfect time to get into the repositioning segment so visualize the market right now you can see Trump is a big green bubble and everything else is red it's sucking up the liquidity the outliers are of course and fcoin fcoin I think appeals to retail because it's just ridiculous it's also AI it's also on salana so you can start to see why people would bet on fcoin hyper liquid really strong as well that's obviously a beneficiary of the amount of trading volume right now but uh I'm a big believer in hype and I've got quite a big spot position in hype salana big beneficiary Jupiter obviously the main decks on salt gobbled up a lot of the volume doing really well and some rwa stuff as well um which is a signal that the market is anticipating that to be a trend that performs really well however just cuz some alts are down doesn't mean they're dead there's actually some good opportunities as I discussed before as liquidity is getting sucked into Trump values of these coins are going down you can DCA into them so when liquidity goes back if you've DCA into the strong stuff a lot of that stuff is going to pump again so you actually have a window here and the window is from now until whenever Trump actually puts in a a top to DCA into some of these coins now I discussed the whiff trade before I think that could be one of them as a trade but my focus is mostly on rwa infrastructure and AI so we'll get into some of those coins now Co Chiller says here honestly think the players buying infrastructure on chain coins going to have a hard time with memes battling for mind share infra is the easier bet especially if it underpins major narrative angles being offered massive discounts this is where you build in my opinion 100% building positions in top AI infra rwa infra I think that that is they're the priority DCA for me right now so um also you have the regulatory wins shifting a lot which are going to be beneficiaries for a lot of these coins too so let's discuss some of them now in rwa I mean cheex is the one that's on salana so no wonder that price is actually doing okay this is probably the main rwa proxy on salana so for me this is one that I've DCA pretty heavily into over the last week it's one of my biggest rwa positions now um and rwa is one of my biggest positions in crypto overall so this is a bet that I'm taking over the next few months off the back of the regulatory uh changes as well as some of the fundamentals that are happening on that side obviously there are other rwa coins but that's probably the the number one right now then AI is another sector that I mean if you just look at the monthly performance defi ai ai agents they've been some of the strongest performers in the market now you're seeing memes perform but that is being held up by Trump because Trump's are memes memes so it's like swaying the overall index technically memes are a top performing narrative again but it's mostly just Trump but AI agents aren't going away in my opinion I actually think the AI agents on Soul become pretty good bids especially like the strongest ones there's a couple like LMT for example this is a a very strong AI project on Soul this isn't going to play out instantly their product is still a few months away but as a DCA especially as things keep bleeding as a longer term play this is one that I have a good amount of conviction in look at some of these other players as well in the def AI space that have been hit that are fundamentally very strong like hey Anon that's the leading defi AI play if you think Ai and and AI agents are going to come back this is an obvious one to get exposure to Def AI you can see my spreadsheet of some other coins that I posted the other day here a BT griffan um I actually highlighted these on yesterday's show as DCA they've already bounced quite nicely right but a lot of these are still down mode grift any are these are the def AI tokens virtual a16z heart EMP mates as a bit more of a risk on like virtuals of salana play all of these are plays that you could look at potentially in terms of um dcang 2 obviously do your own research look at which ones make the most sense for you a couple videos back I I gave my full opinion on each of these old coins but the tldr is the AI agents now I think become pretty good dcas as Trump sucks up liquidity in the market so does rwa although it's still showing good relative strength and and so do a couple memes not all memes but a Pepe I don't think's going away with I think from a technical perspective has easy in validation right now and bigger fundamental players there are a couple I I'm spotting here like beam I'm still bullish on Ena like these are these are projects which I think are still pretty good tokens to hold especially if we go into an an allcoin run at some point as liquidity rotates back um and then my final piece of advice as I mentioned earlier is go on to moonshot and look at the tokens which are gaining volume there because I think there is a narrative there around trading some of these moonshot tokens considering a lot of Normy retailers coming back by the way if you want to trade any of these tokens bitg has pretty much all these tokens listed on the exchange and we actually have a very amazing bonus for you right now where if you deposit money into the exchange you're going to get a 10% cash back for for free and actually it's up to 20% if you deposit $100 so if you deposit $100 you're going to get $20 for free if you deposit $500 you're going to get $50 if you deposit ,000 you're going to get 100 and all you need to do is hold your money in there for a day so theoretically you could just deposit hold in for a day and withdraw and milk the the sign up bonus I probably shouldn't be saying that but that's one thing you can do but obviously if you're going to trade coins anyway on an exchange bit has most of the major coins right now it has Trump if you want to trade trump it has most of the def AI coins I've been discussing and the AI coins axt you can see here AI 16z ET uh so if you do want a place that has all the listings but also you can get a very nice bonus link in the description below to my custom campaign where you can get up to $5,000 which you can then use to go and DCA into your AI agents or whatever else you want to buy so instead of us giving you an air drop you can just choose what you want to buy so I'll leave a link in the description below to that I'll also leave a link in the description to the mils high club if you want the latest updates I'm actually about to jump on an AMA over there right now hopefully you have a lovely rest of your day and uh found this video valuable see you later peace out"
