days before Donald Trump's inauguration on this night Trump's new cryptos are David Sachs hosted a crypto ball in Washington the biggest names were in attendance crypto ball baby go the hottest performers the most reputable people and biggest grifters I'm here directly from the crypto ball in Washington DC as you can see behind me it is a large crowd crypto is going to be a very big part of the future and president Trump has managed to Galvanize so many in this community together the support in the room for him is amazing and the projects and the names of the people involved are even bigger so the the reality is is reporting live to you crypto is definitely backing Donald Trump bigly so pay attention to what's more to come thank you and signing out see you soon at this event in front of so many crypto movers and shakers David Sachs once again declared that Donald Trump and this new Administration will be supporting crypto like never before the reign of terror against crypto is over and the beginning of innovation in America for crypto has just begun at this same time during the crypto ball Trump's memec coin launched in stealth today's video is brought to you by silent

I'll link my full tutorial video in the description use my affiliate link for 10% off all platform fees nobody at the event seemed to have any clue that it happened nobody owned any nobody knew anything about it choose Rich Nick actually went live documenting the initial hours of the launch we're live at the crypto ball and the official Trump token just launched people are are going absolutely crazy here oh my God these people just everyone's can't even believe it they're shocked at it's going here actually I'm one of the only people at this event that owns a token this guy right here he owns the token also thank you to Nick send me the ca i s him I sent him the contract address we've doubled our money and apparently Trump bought thwn what the hell is going on nobody here owns the token nobody literally nobody other than me and this guy I keep trying to get people the contract address and they're like what the hell are you talking about bro and this has been confirmed it seems close to zero people at the crypto ball knew anything about Trump's meme coin launch zero so I just got back from the crypto ball and as you saw in the videos literally nobody at this event was aware of the token there were basically five Deens at the event who knew anything about what was going on but yeah nobody had any idea I couldn't get anybody to comment on it whatsoever there were people who said they bought it 100K uh and I one of the guys next to me ended up making like a significant amount of money but in general nobody had any knowledge of this token it is so hard to believe that Donald Trump would actually do this I mean some people thought Trump's account was hacked I thought it was hacked initially but this is real Eric Trump proudly confirmed this I am extremely proud what we continue to accomplish in crypto Trump is currently the hottest digital meme on Earth and I truly believe that world Liberty finance will revolutionize defy and CI and will be the future of Finance we are just getting started Eric Trump of course has spoken before on why the trumps are so supportive of crypto guys I've seen the modern Financial system be weaponized I've seen politics be weaponized I've seen the legal system in this world be weaponized and it's one of the reasons that I love crypto it's one of the reasons I so strongly believe in defi I saw you guys go through those same attacks every single day I saw them come after you I saw them strip your bank accounts I saw them cancel you like crazy the same thing that they were doing to us because that we were running for politics is the exact same thing that they were doing to the crypto industry so is this a good idea or is this a bad idea what do you think about Trump's new mem coin comment below your thoughts on Trump's mcoin because there are basically two schools of thought behind this I think either you think this is a major scam or you think this is incredibly exciting some people like coffeezilla here say that this is clearly a scam grift bad idea this distribution is like insane it's historic in its stupidity it's historic in its grift the level of scan here to use the days before your presidency your inauguration to use that as a hype project for the meme 80% is owned by the Trump Camp only 20% goes to the public 10% went to the liquidity pool and 10% went to the public allocation in addition $ 12 million has been made in fees already just on the trading volume and then others in crypto seem really excited about this they say Trump is the man we should support Trump like Trump is supporting us Trump won't fail this meme won't fail I mean listen to this insane reaction this is the president of the United States of America he supported crypto he's the one that's been pping this so you need to support him go and buy and a the [\u00a0__\u00a0] out of this coin now under 100 bucks is cheap because we've got four years of this [\u00a0__\u00a0] mate four [\u00a0__\u00a0] years of the president pping the coin this is day one this is real this is some real [\u00a0__\u00a0] mate did you ever feel like you could be living this we dream this stuff man we dreamed the craziest [\u00a0__\u00a0] and now it's like it's a [\u00a0__\u00a0] life like we're here right now the president launching [\u00a0__\u00a0] coins man I can't wait for his next loss I can't wait for the next thing whatever it is I'm buying I'm buying I'm getting involved this is him this is real this is us we are riding this [\u00a0__\u00a0] to the [\u00a0__\u00a0] Stratosphere mate like this this this this is day one day [\u00a0__\u00a0] one day one man day one where's it going to be where's it going to be in 4 years of his presidency and even coffeezilla agrees with that over the next four years Trump coin could be really big how do you expect people to lose interest in a coin when the guy is running the Free World the biggest issue of course besides the fact that this seems just like a general money grab is the fact that insiders control nearly 80% of all coins I mean at least he's pretty transparent about this on the front page of his website inside control 80% they'll gain access to these vested tokens over the next 3 to 12 months coffee Zilla explains what we know so basically Trump launched this through cic digital who I think he launched his other nfts with according to this article by ABC cic digital is fully owned by the Donald Trump revocable trust so it's kind of unclear exactly like is he getting paid a licensing deal for this is he just one of the guys it's it's not that clear I think that's kind of intentional that it's not that clear here's the creators here's the allocation so there's six groups who are getting the rest of the 80% and they're all labeled very obscurely like it's just creators in cic digital one cic digital 2 3 4 5 six that's it that's all the description we get at least on this page and you can see that they're not locked up at the start they have a 3 to 12 month lockup duration depending on the group and uh basically they unlock over 24 months that's the punchline so over 3 years all of this will be unlocked this token will be diluted by the rest of that 80% and you know that Hawk 2 a Haley Welch who seemed to have just gotten cancelled for doing exactly this just weeks ago there's an actual like I had to interrupt you Nick well hello there but any who I'm going to go to bed and I'll see you guys tomorrow okay uh for I guess we're talking over here and I I don't know uh uh she's got to be looking at this and asking hey can I come back now y'all why can Trump do this and I can't so to me my thoughts on all of this just like some of the other Chach keys that Trump was selling during his campaign run to me this is a bad look unless maybe the money's going to charity or or something like that but then on the other hand I think well if Trump can do this why can't many other people do this I think crypto is about to get really big its next order of magnitude up we might start seeing other celebrities athletes companies start doing this we could see a super cycle in crypto like we've never seen before perhaps with aom bubble like bust once we get to the top at the moment millionaires continue to be Minted as we speak Donald Trump just made a massive buy 20 million ethereum Trump's altcoin wallet is growing we've said for years that 2025 will be the biggest crypto Bull Run of of all time and to me it looks like it's happening strap in my friends subscribe to altcoin daily stay informed if you're interested in making money in crypto subscribe to altcoin daily right now and watch our video content daily we're all waiting we're all watching for the Bitcoin strategic Reserve our currency is crashing and will soon no longer be the world standard which will be our greatest defeat frankly in 200 years there will be no defeat like that that will take us away from being even a great power who knows maybe we'll pay off our $35 trillion hand him a little crypto check right we'll hand him a little Bitcoin and wipe out our $35 trillion but how do you in breaking news Melania Trump now just launched her own meme coin wow I don't know about you but I can't wait to see what happens next"
