    "transcript": " what's up everyone welcome back to the channel today I have a very special guest returning to the channel Jordi Alexander we have a lot to discuss today thanks for coming on absolutely you know it's been a crazy start to the year you can see Bitcoin right now is and this video might be posted a few hours after recording but pushing above 100K again after there's been a lot of excitement and anticipation heading into the Trump uh inauguration which is kind of crazy because 4 days ago people were saying the cycle was over so what do you make of all of this crazy price action recently um you know everyone is hoping that we're going to see some executive orders some big you know announcements I don't know that it's all going to be impactful and something that can pass Congress or enactable but um it's hard to be you know shorting the market when you're about to get some uh some Trump you know show about crypto and crypto and Trump have been a match made in heaven you we remember Trump last time he was quite anti- crypto because he didn't have any so he wasn't a back holder he wasn't pumping the bag at all but actually like he's the ultimate kol and crypto needs you know people that are you know flashy and Loud Like Trump so it's it's a perfect match and and we'll see how things go once he's in office do you think he's been buying up crypto behind the scenes preparing he's definitely I mean I don't know if he's been buying he's definitely been gifted a lot of crypto that's for sure we know that much so he owns a lot yeah he definitely owns I don't know about a lot but he he he owns you know a decent amount and his children his sons seem to all you know be interested we we're seeing them involved in many ways um in crypto right now I guess one of the major questions is Will trump create a Bitcoin strategic Reserve right now the old's on polym Market at 35% it even spiked up to 42% today of trump uh putting in an executive order within you know the first 100 days what do you think the likelihood of him actually doing this is I mean these poly Market things you got to redefined print like what exactly is g to you know make it go yes instead of no and sometimes um there's these gray areas where you know he announces something but it doesn't actually do anything or may or maybe uh he can't call it a reserve but it's more of like a you know an executive order not to sell Bitcoin and does that count so um H I'm very much in the middle here I think he's gonna be able to get something that says they're not going to sell Bitcoin uh that they that they hold but I don't expect them to necessarily be able to buy on you know buy buy crypto on the market and it's not just Bitcoin like there was a a rumor that seems to have been refuted saying they're going to make a reserve of a bunch of US coins like salana and XR r p um I don't know I don't know that the government is going to be buying altcoins or shitcoins anytime soon zooming out a little bit do you think that Trump is a positive force for crypto like do you do you think that his tenure especially maybe 2025 specifically is going to be bullish overall for crypto or do you think a lot of this stuff is just noise and kind of hopium heading into the inauguration it's definitely bullish because it'll rebalance the um you know the gentler years the gentler years were just so difficult for especially us-based uh business and teams in crypto to operate properly just having that out the way um is going to be a very nice Tailwind for uh at least the next couple years I think it gets very political as we get to the end of the term and especially if at the time you know there's a lot of backlash against Trump for you know uh you know may maybe like econom is not not doing good and um if we end up in a recession which we might at some point in the next four years then I'm sure the priorities will shift away from uh you know pumping crypto but uh overall good to be out of the gentler era of you know regulation by enforcement what a joke and um yeah I think we might get a bit grifty you know there might be a little bit of um The Other Extreme but it's okay you know at the end of the day um we need to get to like a sane middle at some point but I'm happy to be done with Gensler there was a a quote I tweeted uh uh a few days ago which is 2025 is g to be investors hell and Traders Paradise so um investors hell because if you just hold and and don't do anything else and you just huddle it's it's going to be very choppy you're going to have a lot of uh it's over it's coming back it's over it's coming back so um yeah here's the quote yeah it's it's going to be uh Traders Paradise investors hell so I think I think that's very accurate this is what I'm expecting this year a lot of chops a lot of that's because of the um just the volatility right people getting shaken out yeah but we're also like in a part of the macro cycle and um I don't know if you want to go go much into macro but we're we're at a point where we've had a huge year in equities I think 25% up it's all been driven by like seven stocks it's very concentrated um bonds have started like rebelling if you look at like the the yields on even the US 10-year bond which is is the most important bond in the world like this is the most liquid most you know bought bond in the world the 10-year us Bond no one's buying it it's fallen off a cliff like the yields are have skyrocketed despite rates going lower um it's it's it's going towards 5% which we haven't seen so something is not healthy in in the global markets and that's reflected that no one's buying the US 10year Bond no one's buying it yeah so so volatility is coming and and I don't think we're going to have up only markets um yeah here you go I mean this is this is a little bit worrying given that they're cutting rates and this is going up instead of down um a huge red flag huge red flag So when you say it's a huge red flag what are the reasons why it's a red flag it kind of shows that um we're we're we're at a point where the government is issuing so much like new supply of bonds because they have to finance everything they got to finance the debt they got to finance all the expenses and there's not enough money to buy the bonds like so the yields are going up which makes it more expensive for the government it creates this like Loop this like very bad Loop where um the only way out there's only two ways out one is like we get really lucky with some crazy productivity gains from AI or something that just completely like you know uh make every country every every company profitable because they're so uh so productive that's one thing I don't know if we're there yet the other thing is like if Elon and and Co manage to just like find all these wasted expenses and and Doge you know the department of government efficiency like fixes the supply and then they don't need to issue bonds because they're not spending money I don't think they're going to stop spending money and I don't think they're going to be able to get all these like vested interest out of Washington and all these like Swamp People that all you know getting money out of the Pentagon I don't think you know even Elon is going to be able to do much there so um it's a red flag it's a huge red flag and um it kind of shows that we're quite uh potentially like either um you know late in in a micro cycle or uh maybe entering like an inflationary wave we'll see and what happens if we are entering an inflationary W generally like stocks are not going to uh do very well um I think crypto will outperform equities and outperform um you know non- crypto beta markets because of that regulatory Tailwinds so I would still rather be in crypto rather than than equities but um it's going to be correlated it's all going to be correlated right it's all one liquidity trade if if liquidity goes down people are generally poorer across the board um then then crypto gets affected as well but if if we do see inflation coming back Trump's kind of his hands are kind of tied a little bit um as to how much he can actually do to mitigate that and obviously the FED do don't you think that could create this environment just kind of like a counter argument where there could be like fomo back into risk because people kind of need to chase the gains it's that's kind of what could affect the final stage of the bull caus the blow off top uh no they're not going to go into risk they might look for safe havens and things like gold come into play potentially um things like what if Bitcoin starts acting like a I mean at times it has it hasn't for long periods of time what if it kind of starts acting like a digital gold I think it's possible it will if certain countries um start to view it as like an alternative to you know buying us bonds and they just buy some Bitcoin because it's like you know maybe this is going to perform better uh that's possible and that will create like a super cycle in in Bitcoin in terms of alts unfortunately it's not going to be a safe haven and there's no scenario in which um it'll you know be correlated to Gold when you're looking at something like you know um some n name your altcoin uh layer one or something do you believe in the fouryear cycle in terms of like where we are now because obviously there's been a lot of talk about cycle topping or do you just think this is just a new paradigm where it's completely just based on risk appetite liquidity Global Market correlation yeah I think the fouryear cycle is probably ended I think I believed in it and and and I thought like it would uh kind of play out how I did with the last Bitcoin happening which was you know again bullish once again which is great um I think now we're sort of entering this like more complicated fuddled mess of Tailwinds headwinds uh it's not going to smoothly play out there's going to be a lot of like nominal gains but uh in real terms not so much because you know we're getting a lot of the basement um the US dollar is being very strong the US dollar has kind of gone to like one uh 110 which um look at this I mean is is going is very strong this is a problem for a lot of countries around the world um China included a lot of the Asian countries when H having this kind of like strong dollar um it's also a problem if it reverses we're kind of like in a very like difficult difficult spot now um this is would Trump want to push this down a little bit because he's all about protectionism and local manufacturing he doesn't want like a super high dollar uh yeah they're gonna they're gonna bring it down by printing more um great and this is kind of like the bullish case and yeah yeah it's bullish in the short term yeah yeah I mean that would probably be bullish for risk Assets in the short term at least the narrative around it oh Trump's printing maybe that could I mean my thesis is that probably uh carries over into like maybe q1 I think maybe later in the year things start to become a bit more dicey or trickier to dissect yeah basically like the reason this is happening is people still don't have an alternative to to dollars there's no clear thing I mean we've seen gold obviously do extremely well if you look at gold like the chart of gold it's not used to having these like kind of uh you know it did in 2003 to 2010 it had this kind of runup but we haven't seen that in over a decade and now it's just completely exploded it's clear that a lot of the Russian bricks type of countries are piling into gold because they don't want to risk their assets getting seized um so so this has also been doing super well yeah I guess a lot hinges on how Bitcoin reacts right if people um people I mean it has been on a big run this is kind of your not bare case necessarily but something to be cautious of like it has run up a lot so whether people start foming into it now as like a digital gold is kind of it might be wishful thinking but as you said before the the risk appetite of the market if if it does come back with this whole Trump's printing it could be good in the short term um so that kind of Segways into a question do you think do you think Bitcoin is going to have this big peak at some point this year like a lot of people are talking about I'm hearing a lot of you know 120 140 150 is is that on your on your list of predictions for this year it's possible it's really hard to predict Bitcoin because you you can get uh new buyers come in and if you get new buyers that are massive like you know countries and stuff like this then then you get a massive leg otherwise we're just going to chop like you saw like in the previous months before November we just had this $60,000 kind of back and forth it was always $60,000 for months um we could have that around 100,000 because yeah we could have that around 100K because 100K is such a shelling point where if it's below people want to buy it oh it's under 100K and if it's above it kind of starts looking expensive like I don't want to buy 105,000 Bitcoin this is so brutal for alts like this was so brutal um yeah this this is a very possible scenario very possible where we just kind of chop sideways I mean then there's this question about altcoins which we're going to get into allcoins in uh in in a couple of minutes here because I want to ask you about Ai and and all this sort of stuff but for altcoins we're kind of enter this rotators market now right where like um there are these narratives Ai and then memes and now it's the trafi coins and then next week it'll be AI again and then it'll be gaming and that's what tends to happen if the dilution of alts outpaces like the new liquidity coming in which has been the case and will continue to be the case so it's kind of this it's a very difficult Market to hold a lot of alts like even I've had to trim my portfolio down from maybe you know 20 to 30 alts back down to like 10 core High conviction positions and then trade the rest yeah because it's very tricky it is tricky um we we've seen a lot of the coins had attention like some of the big meme coins for example you know name name Your Meme coin uh popcat or peanut or all these ones that we're trading at couple billion um they're all down like super bad and it kind of shows that it's a rotators game right there's going to be new attention if all you're if all you're doing is getting attention that's not going to last you know attention flows and and goes somewhere else so the only coins that will do well are the ones that are more fundamentally based and um and can also like evolve with uh with with things changing so um yeah it's going to be investor as hell yeah I mean I think I think for me personally and everyone has a different strategy um depending on whether you're active trading or a little bit more hands off I've got like a basket of high conviction assets which are more fundamentally driven I'll probably do a video which goes deeper into them and then I have these like mini portfolio is like my AI agent portfolio which I kind of trade like some of it I'm willing to hold longer term but if there's an opportunity to trade it shorter term I will so I think it's about adaptability it's a year of because the thing is if you got entries in 2023 even early 2024 ideally in the bare Market you have more leeway like there's more room for error with how you enter and exit alts whereas the further the cycle goes on the more room for error there is in terms of holding spot yeah so yeah you have to be a bit more adaptive I think yeah and the good thing about having less coins you know not having 50 coins but having 10 15 coins is that you can actually keep on top of you know what's happening in them and like if there's some important catalysts maybe there's like a huge unlock you know we have some coins with like really bad tokenomics like the unlocks sort of um start CL clobbering them and um even some of the really big performers might uh might get buried by by the force of gravity so uh having 10 or 15 you get you get to know what's going on it does kind of feel like the next market and obviously it's very hard to time because you need as you mentioned before with the xrp short you like you need a lot of margin but it does feel like the next bare Market will be home to some of the biggest short prints in history because some of these bubbles are so big and are so liquid so once things turn with the amount of Supply like we're going to see some alts yeah I don't mean to be too pessimistic because it's probably later in the year but nonetheless when it does happen there's going to be a lot of opportunity I think on that side of things if if you can stay in that game and not get squeezed out of it yeah um uh shorting is is definitely difficult and um you know it can make you pull your hair out if you short too early so uh yeah which is kind of why these bubbles a form like the reason why we get these crazy bubbles is because people can't short easily like if they could then they would keep things in line but they're they're so hesitant to do it because it's so easy to get burned that um that they avoid it and then like it's only buyers and and sort of we get we get these bubbles I'll say this if we didn't have the Trump inauguration and potential you know Buzz about is he gonna do some executive order or something I think we would already be um in in like a bare market like we we would have started the bare Market you know now I think the fact that Trump is uh you know creating a little bit of hopium is only reason why we're po the if all of this hype is just a bubble because of trump opion doesn't the inauguration become sell the news yeah unless they you know there's a there's a there's a 20% chance that they do announce something just so bullish like we might hear something like you know um May maybe they have some way to buy stuff like you know it's a little bit risky until you see what they're actually going to do yeah um but there will become a point inevitably in the next few months where um you know it's back to DC as usual and and everyone's talking about some Foreign Relations war or something going on and and crypto is not going to be um at the Forefront but right now I think Trump is happy to be the crypto president and and start off with a bank so um and he won't want to get into off first and then like if you just think about it from a vanity perspective he probably doesn't want to see Bitcoin tank the second he gets in like maybe he'll he'll just say stuff to just try and keep the markets bubbly in the first kind of month or two I guess that's the Hope right yeah um but I will be cautious after um after the inauguration for sure so you're not longing the dino coins in hope that Trump sends them to Valhalla you know the people who did have have done have done well so good for them um are they exiting now or they just going to trip it it's it's sort of um depends how greedy they are and and or maybe like you know they have some thesis um I personally don't have enough of a view of of like you know why why Dino coins will uh will get ETFs and then everyone in the in the world is going to buy the ETF of of Litecoin or whatever so um before we get into agents I want to ask you like what do you think of sectors like rwa because I think there are some tangible changes that will benefit um some of these protocols maybe not every single one that you're seeing on screen but generally speaking the regulatory framework should help a lot of these uh projects actually Thrive and build out business models so do you think there's a world where some of these projects actually you know perform well post Trump because they have more freedom to get licensing uh maybe companies that were scared to tokenize like I'm friends with the chintai guys and I hold a bag of checks and uh one thing that they're really excited about is the appetite maybe for tokenizing assets is a lot higher now because they feel like they have a bit more freedom that a lot of companies didn't want to risk it putting you know a billion dollars in assets onto the blockchain last year but now they might feel comfortable with a new like SEC chair so I'd love your take on on rwa and the appetite for tokenization I mean rwa is having the category um one of the categories you know obviously like ai's done incredible things but apart from that since the election kind of what you said there's been an expectation that maybe this is going to be very good because the Big Wall Street firms and the big banks will start getting more involved um and so the sector has done very well if you look at all these charts over the last three months they've all doubled I think like across well I know they're getting more involved based on conversations I've had with a few teams um in rwa because I'm I'm in touch with yeah Pendle clear Paul chintai a few others as well uh yeah love to keep tabs on and I know for a fact especially in the Middle East like the region that I'm currently in like there is a lot of active investment into that space and I've even heard of the US and these banks that you referenced more open to it now like I've heard this on the ground you know that these conversations are happening so it's not a l yeah um it's happening but then like the question is okay if it happens and you know we've seen headlines like putting all the real estate St on the blockchain all this stuff um all of it's meaningless unless like there's an actual use case at the end where users do want that tokenization because they want to buy a share of you know some flat in a different country just to diversify their portfolio um and and maybe that's there maybe and maybe uh people that's pretty cool isn't it like being able to instead of you know if I want to buy a villa in Thailand because it was something I was considering last year you know you look into it it's like oh well you know you got to get a local lawyer and a representative and then you got to fly there and then you're paying tax and then then there's all this risk like it is a cool concept to be able to take usdt and right now I can go buy a villa in pukat like on my you know click of a button bang I've got exposure if I think that's a good purchase I see that as a use case I mean retail generally want to buy property because they want to spend time living in it they they don't necessar with with Home Loans mortgage yeah they don't they don't necessarily just like want to speculate on you know the real estate of a of a certain location maybe maybe they do um anyway I mean the bottom line is there'll be many things attempted and I think most of them will fail but a few might succeed and those that succeed will be huge uh but a lot of this stuff might not actually have a use case even when you know we've seen a ton of um Treasury yield being brought on chain some of it permission some of it not um everything from like you know Biddle funds and and everything down um you know for for those things to still be useful you literally need someone that doesn't normally have access or has access but you know they're willing to just you know use an onchain product instead because it gives them more freedom or or ability to borrow or whatever um and um there are those people but we we're kind of like waiting to see a big rwa use case I think um I'm hopeful that something will will will blow up but you know the obvious stuff is like can you can you let people around the world access like us um markets right like equities or um things like this uh just to make it easy for anybody to access so yeah there is there is some low hanging fruit I guess in terms of pumpamentals there's two discussions here there's the long-term business model which is obviously important for sustainability and then there's pumpamentals because like I mean if someone announces a big tokenization of billions of dollars of real estate probably going to be good for the token going up in the short term but I do agree like for this to actually play out longer term we need to see like real business models and real Revenue you know actually be generated by these protocols so I agree I'll um yeah I'll give you my thoughts on a couple of these after um the maybe in DM because I've got I've got some Alpha on a couple of them but uh yeah obviously the manra and Ono trade have were super good I've mostly taken profits on the majority of my positions across both as they went I I kind of sold uh a chunk of my Mantra a bit too early um I think I remember texting you as well you're like this is just a crazy bubble and the bubble just got bigger and bigger and bigger uh it was it was nuts to see yeah these things generally can run until their unlocks happen and then when the unlocks happen it um you know it sort of changes the supply demand again but um yeah like you said there there's there's been some big announcements so um um Middle East money specifically I've also kind of visited your your part of the world and I've talked to some of the the big family offices as they call them um they they love the idea of rwa I mean for them it's um I would say it's like the xrp equivalent where it sounds really good and and it sounds like something they want to invest in because it it sort of uh has like the the technology and also like the legitimacy so they they like the combination yeah 100% it's like if you're on the fence about crypto because you don't know the use case but you understand property it's like an easy kind of sell but whether or not it's like financially beneficial is like guess the question but yeah okay so to finish this video let's go through agents um because this has been according to the data which doesn't lie the top performing narrative year today obviously a slight cool down over the past 24 hours but generally speaking you know def AI up 30 38% AI agents up 28 this is the aggregate index obviously within that you've had some crazy gainers so what do you make of this AI bubble so to speak and how big do you think this bubble could get because if you just look at the chart of the current AI Index right now at 15 bill it's it's I mean it depends what coins you're including right if you start including NE protocol and blockchains then it's higher it's probably around 30 bill but in terms of Agents they're at 15 Bill salax ran to 120 bill that was a big bubble from the last cycle so where do you think all this is going up know I I I know being like pessimistic on like a lot of the other stuff this is one thing that um I am actually like very much on the on the bullish train I think that Ai and crypto are might be the killer use case that um you know we've been waiting for ever since digital gold and stable coins like it's kind of could be the third major major category of uh things that actually find long-term products Market fit I'm very bullish on um the ability for crypto to unlock things for real AI like it's it like the technology is just match so well and they've been created independently and I think these are the two huge Technologies of our time you know I've spent my career in more of like uh you know the the crypto instead of the AI one but um I talk to people who have spent their career in the other one and um our conversations are like damn like these things are going to come like there there's legitimate things that uh make sense and um you know this agents sub narrative is a part of it I think um it's the strongest thing we've seen because if you remember like the previous stuff of um all the render and all all this kind of like uh iets and all these things um it yeah I mean well there so there's the hardware stuff which is like you know decentralized graphics cards um so that category which is okay but you know there's there's a certain limit to how much de centralized compute you know you you need or how efficient that is um while the agent category is going to be something that has just so much potential because the technology um is is rapidly improving not as a meme where you know the price goes up and we're like oh the technolog is improving because the price went up the actual Web Two technology stat of these things in a year is going to be so insanely uh Stronger that anything that is in crypto manages to add value to it and combine with it is going to be incredibly valuable this is like the only thing that I've been like so excited about in in a long time so um yeah when you're saying where this is going man this is Tiny the only thing I'll say and like there's a reason why it might make sense for it to be tiny um it's a new category and you know these like initial winners or like the initial Blue Chips you know quote unquote um are not necessarily Gonna Last because um they haven't like proven themselves virtual ai6 Z ax BT these are the three like leaders at the moment yeah yeah um fi which I'll get your thoughts on in a in a minute up there as well in terms of just market cap and then you've got all the sub agents which are also kind of maybe not on coin but I know on chain they're kind of doing a lot of volume yes my mental framework is in a year's time the crypto AI agent or AI kind of you know front end uh category will be like at least 10x bigger I mean it could be much more than that but like minimum 10x bigger but that doesn't mean that all these coins are going to be up 10x because yeah um there there's a lot to learn over the next year and there's a lot of new things that are going to launch and a lot of things that are going to have to Pivot and a lot of things that will lose their Buzz so uh it's not as simple as just like buying everything and um and seeing you know the 10x getting realized you have to be kind of careful uh on what you're buying and um some of it's not going to be done you know unless you're paying attention like you have to you have to kind of stay engaged this is the category leaders change and this is the category that I would uh I I would you know spend time staying on top of over the next months like researching and yeah just being in the loop like the thing is since the leaders are changing so much I actually made this point on a video a couple of days ago I guess the issue is if you were betting on AI right and you wanted exposure to the top AI proxies in March 2024 you would bet on render or fet and and whenever AI pumps you make money in October or November maybe it was T you know whatever tow whenever AI pumps if you're in tow you'd make money but it does feel like now um unless you're in Virtual or ai6 like if you along any of those other AI coins you wouldn't make money so like it just keeps evolving over time in three months there's probably going to be a new play that whenever AI gets hype it pumps so it's it's a tricky one to set and forget that's why I made that point earlier in the video I've got this AI portfolio right it's about 12 maybe 8 to 12 coins but it's not really a portfolio because it's like I kind of chop I'm chopping in and out of it a lot I find myself like selling a lot of a coin and buying a brand new one because I'm just finding stuff all the time like def AI didn't exist a week ago and all of a sudden you have you know Daniel sesta with hey Anon and this like new wave griffan now all of a sudden so I got some exposure to this and now it's pumping and now I'm like okay what's next so it's like memes it's like constantly new ones all the time it's different than memes though it's different the reason why it's different I mean it's it's similar and like you get new ones but um with memes like uh it's not so much about the talent of the team behind it whatever like the meme gets launched and then if it's funny enough and it's a fart coin then it just farts and you know it kind of takes a life not tyi's favorite coin this is not like that um the coins that will do do well over like the next months uh are going to keep shipping and they're going to ship things that are novel and actually like relevant to you know using the AI technology and so Talent of the team and like how technical they are how in plugg they are how connected they are to like the the web two Labs or the open source community and also like how good their tokenomics are like what's the point of the token because a lot of these things like don't need a token it's just you know AI xpt is it's it's got a token and then maybe you can like buy the terminal but the alpha is obviously not very good so you know anyway I'm not going to kind of like uh get into like specific projects I appreciate everybody who's trying to actually build and and put real effort but the the point is the the quality of the team is very different than a mem coin it's going to matter massively and that's what's going to drive things forward they're responsible for shipping all of these products remaining adaptive yeah yeah I agree so uh I'm betting on the most talented teams that I find I I um I'm very kind of focused on uh betting on the people who the most connected H and when I say connected like connected to the actual like uh technology that's being developed because these are supposed to enable the AI technology and and and and expand it into blockchain so you need to have that connection so look uh the ones that like seem to have it and this is not even on your list but like you know one is uh obviously World worldcoin they it's sort of like co-founded by S Altman who you know it looks like uh chat GB3 is getting very close to AGI and uh you know Sam is very involved with worldcoin so it's not it's not even on the list here but uh that's that's one that we're definitely like keeping you know uh being we're invested in this uh I'm kind of personally long this thing and and I think it's very undervalued and it's because like crypto Twitter has not they haven't created a lot of uh you know crypto specific content what do you make of the dilution in terms of like the the circulating is only 10% yeah I mean these guys are like hoping to get worldcoin in the hands of like every human on earth and they've onboarded so far about like 1% of the earth I think um they're they're somewhere the in the sort of like you know tens of millions which is a lot um but they need enough coins you know there's a lot of coins to be given out you know when you sign up you get I signed up and I don't know if it's because it's in Singapore or something but I got like $200 just to just to sign up so it's a lot of money um maybe it's less in other countries I'm not sure exactly how their Economist do it but bottom line is you can see the price is tank but that's not a reflection of the market cap which has gone up just because there's been so many unlocks in the first year already yeah back when it pumped at the beginning I wasn't in favor of worldcoin because the float was so tiny that you you were going to get wrecked buying it um I think now like the way I see it is like 22 billion FTV when SOI is uh what is that like 50 or something um this is a much more relevant sort of uh chain for for the world in terms of AI rather than like you know another salana killer um so just looking at the FTV um even that looks cheap to me so even even though there's a lot to come so it's it's um it's an interesting one I think it'll start it'll make noise in uh in 2025 because at some point um you know uh open AI will do very well it'll kind of have have this groundbreaking uh model it'll release and I think worldcoin will will benefit directly I think directly like there'll be a direct benefit um so this is one I think this is obviously a big cap project 22 billion FTV so um it's not GNA 100x but uh and I'll front run you I know the other one you're going to mention is Fraser so I actually teased this on the show two days ago I said I was going to get on a podcast with you and ask you about Fraser because it was one that I I was considering taking a position in but um I want to hear it from the horse's mouth because you know a lot I actually haven't I I wanted to even privately have a conversation with you about it but we can do it publicly like what's uh what's Fraser what does it do what's the alpha yeah let's do it publicly I see here you just brought up the Bloomberg article that just came out as well so it has gotten a lot of like mainstream attention both from uh yeah like you know the Elon musks of the world and Brian Armstrong all these people um because they are actually not just trying to build something to speculate on they're actually thinking about deeply like how is this technology from AI going to be useful for uh for blockchain and you know I've had the the privilege of speaking with the team and um I don't think anything is remotely close in terms of like how much they understand understand just the fundamentals of you know how these things can play together and um the main uh thing to look at is is this like concept of sovereignty like Sovereign agents because agents will only be able to be powerful if they have their own resources so they can spend money they can do things imagine if you had no money if you had zero doar and you have like call your mom and ask her like hey Mom like uh I need I need to lunch can you please like you know pay for it and like you you wouldn't be able to get anything done you would not be a sovereign miles right like if you had to do that so this is like a very good like way to think about why uh the next generation of agents that will actually be powerful will'll need you know it'll need resources and we we'll be we'll be able to like sovereignly sort of spend the money um no one is thinking about it except for the frasia team like this is the only team in the whole space and both web 2 and web 3 that is like a further ahead of everybody in terms of developing the the pieces of the technology that are going to be needed for sovereignty of Agents the web2 labs you know they they know that there's going to be some need for money for your agents but they're they're kind of maybe maybe they'll get your credit card and hope not to you know do something stupid with it uh but crypto is such a much better fit for moving money around the world we we all know that like especially if it's like censor sensorless uh uh uh money and um the thing is like once you give an agent money and you give it a wallet what are the risks what do we have to like uh do to govern it like all these questions are going to be very very important as 2025 rolls on and uh Fai um is the only project that I've seen and this is why like I'm most excited about this that is like head-on tackling all these things and like first of all they showed that you know if you're uh letting somebody jailbreak it and your agent has your wallet it can take your wallet I mean you have to be very careful with this stuff they they did this competition where people were trying to talk to frasia and convince her to you know release the funds and somebody managed to jailbreak it um so you know this is like one of the stunts that has kind of gotten a lot of attention but there are solutions to these things and they're working on these Frameworks um they've released the docs and people can read them in their framework but uh you know using a lot of the crypto technology like uh trusted execution environments and um you know a lot of The Enclave backups and um you know a lot of the pieces that will'll create a framework that gives agents the the safe governable power um is being built and this is just like something that I think um is is is going to be a huge winner in 2025 I think one of the issues with it and this is a good thing in terms of financial opportunity potentially but one of the issues was I couldn't find that much information like that's why I wanted to speak to you because when you when you like suggested hey I was look into this I went to the website it doesn't really tell you much so if you had to do like a TLD click on uh if you go back to the website click on click on framework um so there there is a road map here and you can you can kind of uh dig in and understand a lot of um you know what what the plans are and what's being released um but you you you can see that you know the idea is to um you know create really powerful agents that are governable by humans so it's not something that just you know we have no control over once it once it has sovereignty we also need to have the ability to to govern it and um these things are going to get very very powerful they're going to be smarter than you know a lot of people um so having the structure to to govern them is going to come into play and literally nobody is working on this except for this team so I think um the that the attention on this project is is going to get huge the the perfect uh vehicle to do this right 100% I mean this is like we're this this is like why cryptography makes so much sense like you you create these like um first of all you create an environment for the agents to have sovereignty and like not be influenced by anyone else you know you can't have like a puppet master just pull the string and and change what the agent's doing because uh the the code that it's running is verified and the you know the um uh the G push even like the the hash can get sort of verified that this is this is the actual agent it's doing everything by itself um so like this is one thing and then the next layer is of course you know making them do things that are in benefit of you know the humans not not just do uh you know things that are benefiting themselves and how does the token factor into this so um I I think there's a few ways but um the the idea is like the token is needed for either launching agents and being able to you know use the technology but I think more um more fundamentally there will be token syncs um that will sort of like suck up tokens and I think this is like the best kind of mechanism you have is if you have a token sync so like when you have a in-game currency you know you talk about gaming Diablo or something and and you get all this gold um you don't want to just have the gold going around you need to spend it on something so there have to be things where that the tokens get sunk into and kind of get out of out of the supply um an example could be um you know uh and I think this is like one of the plans uh you know 100 agents get built you know and they all have some way to make money or some some some way to earn price uh if humans want to buy shares let's say like you know you want to be a stockholder of that agent you know I like the uh I like the the agent that's going to be you know tackling this thing um you need to buy a share with Fai that creates a sync because you you're buying it with h with a token so um this is very sustainable I think this is the right tokenomics um and like you said it's very early but um that's that's kind of why it presents potentially like a good ENT point and there's no centralized exchanges yet so um obviously uh AI xpt is on binance now and and it's it's kind of doubled since going on binance but I think what's interesting and maybe you have more context than me like this is already a top five agent play but the Mind share on Twitter is like non-existent relative to the market cap so like clearly I don't know exactly why that is it could be insiders or whales or funds just keep buying it up but it hasn't gained that like Normy kind of audience yet yeah it's it's um it's such a hit with right curvers like these big funds and these like you know big whales like high stakes Capital has talked about it and Eric do eth and um a lot of like the you know the the kind of really big traders who are happy to hold like a multi-million dollar position and not sell it because it's like too big for them um they've all like you know been really liking this coin and it hasn't even crossed the the social threshold of you know everybody's buying it because everybody knows about it they don't really understand it I think the team hasn't done you know what you've seen with uh virtuals and ai6 Z with Shaw and all these teams is that they're they're doing a bunch of you know podcasts and they're going on there there's a purity to this project where they only want frasa to go on a podcast herself when you know when the technology kind of improves in in the next few months and then she can actually herself go because they want to keep it about the project and the agent and like the neutrality rather than you know you got some guy like you know Shaw let's say like going going around and you know talking about butt plugs and and whatever um so it it's it's a bit of a more pure approach yeah yeah yeah I mean and and I think also that's just not that as I said like there's not that much like retail friendly information it's good that you've got the road map here but as that sort of starts to come out like I can see that I actually see that as a positive thing um like kind of information asymmetry so to speak yeah I think the next the next next step will be a um a very like mass media Mass approach get like millions of people uh involved and um there's something in the works I think probably like about a month away that will be you know like a big multi-million dollar pricee pool where people can all participate and uh I think that'll be where we get the Mind share kind of crossing the threshold yeah super interesting um yeah I'm taking an initial position but might need to load up some more I'll do some more research okay do some research there's a lot of cool stuff always research before invest World coin's interesting as well this is something that you've um brought to my attention is cuz cuz I'm always looking at like these larger it's not just about making money on small caps and quick flips I also do like as I said holding that core portfolio of um things that over like six months to 12 months could play out like there's a couple rwa coins which I'm doing that with so this kind of stuff appeals to me for like my large cap you know could you hold this instead of a salana you know kind of thing yeah I mean look look at the price uh it it's very good right now I mean the floor has been like the $2 floor really really doesn't really get breached um it's you know you look at upside but also you look at downside and um we're we're kind of like at a point where it it doesn't really have too much downside because you know I think Sam Alman himself at some point will just you know uh if it goes low he'll he'll just buy it himself he's obviously like you know yeah very wealthy and and cares a lot about this project it's part of his legacy um I've spoken to him personally about it and I know how much he cares and and is involved as well so um yeah I think I think of this one as like a free option where it's a good large cap to hold um and um and upsides there too anything else in particular you want to discuss or because we're at the hour mark so um that's I think we covered the main things and um you know will will obviously like have a lot of developments both on the Trump side and on the AI technology side um so we can we can sync up again but yeah exciting times and just just be ready for uh a lot of volatility is what I'll say yeah yeah make sure you're in the right coins um the right sectors AI clearly being one of them but you also got to be careful as you mentioned not to just long everything and anything got to be selective and yeah hopefully Trump pumps our bags yeah at least in the short term yeah hopefully he does and um there'll be opportunities regardless you know if we get dips I'm definitely keeping you know my personal strategy right now is um I'm keeping some cash to buy dips I think we will get some um we'll get wash outs especially after this sort of like inauguration Mania there'll be some dips and um I'm going to be one of the people kind of looking to to step in when when we see blood and take it take some more positions same yeah that's the plan all right Jordy thanks for joining absolutely thanks for having me come in soon and yeah see you guys in the next one take care"
