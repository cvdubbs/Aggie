    "transcript": " so if you guys have been watching me for long enough you've seen me using things like VWAPs FIBs moving averages talking about horizontal levels and all these types of things And the key word that I always use is confluence Well today I'm going to give you or let you into a sneak peek of some of the secrets behind FIBS How do we pull FIBS how do we use FIBS and how do they help us with our trading strategy so we got so much to talk about today on FIBS guys Let's get right into it And just before we jump into the video I just want to remind you guys that signups to my accelerator course are now open The accelerator course is a 10day fast action course If you want to skip through years and years of screen time and pain and figuring out how to trade well you want to take part in the accelerator course I guarantee you that within 10 days you are going to have an understanding of some basic TA You're going to know how to use it in confluence with some of the indicators that we are using and you are going to be leverage trading within 10 days Now that is my promise to you All you need to do is sign up to the accelerator course It's in the show description below Now let's start talking fibs What are they what do we do with them and how do they help me in my trading firstly there's a couple of important basics you need to know I personally like to use the 382 fib the 0.5 the 618 and the 786 So those are the most important fibs for me And in a couple of examples today I'm going to show you the power of using a 618 And then we are going to tie it all together and show you a little secret called the hot zone indicator So let's get right into this The secret to pulling fibs is understanding that you need to track the higher time frames and then start diving down into the lower time frames Remember the secret with all levels and fibs and VWAPs and all the things of confluence that I like to use They have way more power on higher time frames So the higher time frames obviously become a little less accurate But in terms of the strength and the power of these zones we like to zoom out first So what you have in front of you is a Salana chart And this is the Salana 3-day chart And we're taking information from the extreme lows on December 22 and we're looking at the highs from the Trump pump and the whole Trump memecoin token launch that peaked at 295 This was in January uh earlier this year So we're looking at this whole movement And what I want you guys to see today is the power of these fibs and how they can add confluence to some of your trading So the first thing you want to do is click on the lefth hand menu on trading view You can see the fibs are highlighted here Highlight that Click on fibs then go to the extreme low of the move and you drag it to the highs And for this example I'm using the 382 and the 618 fib Let's let this play out now that we've pulled our fib from the extreme low to the extreme high Let's see what happens Bang Look at that initial reaction on that 382 So once you are zoomed in in terms of a DGEN play there'll be quite a substantial move there for the lower time frame traders But in terms of the higher time frame you can see we had a beautiful reaction off that 382 Now let's let the move finish Bang Look at that 618 coming into play there Boom So once again this example is just to show you the power of these fibs I want you guys to see uh you know that these are this is one of the tools uh in trading and this is one of the tools in creating these big high impact reaction zones that I like to call hot zones So there are multiple things we use from VWAPs and order blocks and higher time frame levels all the way down to these fibs Remember our goal as traders is to always look for as much confluence as possible We don't want to use anything isolated on its own We want to use a group of things together because that is going to tell us balance of probabilities that we may get a reaction on one of those zones Now let's dive in a little bit Let's go in a little bit deeper and let's see some lower time frame fib pools in action Now here's a cool chart for you This is the XRP 1hour chart And what I've done is I've gone back in time to show you a nice example here You can see XRP peaked out at this 3.4 four region and then it slowly started selling off till eventually there was a big dump But what this dump has told us is that we have a major pivot level to the lows and we have a major level to the high So we have two extremes and both of these levels are now going to allow us to pull our fibs either from the high to the low or from the low to the high Now just a note on pulling fibs How do you know when you have to pull a fib from the highs and how do you know when you have to pull a fib from the lows well keep it as simple as this If you're pulling a fib from the highs to the lows you are looking for a zone on that fib where the price might reject And if you are pulling a fib from the low to the highs you are looking for an area where the price might bounce on any pullbacks that you may see So if we are asking the question where could this XRP price potentially reject if the price starts moving up how do I know where this price can fall over how do I identify these areas how's it going to help me as a trader who might be able to look for some shorts in these types of situations so we keep it really simple We take our fibs from the extreme highs Bang And you drag it from the left to the right all the way down And you plant it at the lows And now you're going to use these levels as your guide Let's see how XRP reacts when the price starts moving back up Look at that reaction on that 382 And bang look at that 618 So there's a beautiful rejection there off the 618 So now you've seen two examples of the 382 and the 618 coming into play Now obviously we use the 786 fib as well We use the 0.5 and we use them for different reasons and for different areas on the chart Obviously I'm going to go into that in way more detail in my accelerator course that you guys uh can all take part in We have limited seats available for the next workshop which is around the corner So make sure you sign up Go into the show description and you will see the accelerator course there Now that is going to be moving to a fully paid course in the next few weeks So make sure you sign up now and take advantage This workshop is going to be free uh for you guys to take part in And here is a cool video from one of our students that has taken part in the course Crypto is fast-paced So for me I want to understand what's happening now And that's where Training Accelerator came in It's literally a crash course that teaches you how to understand what's likely to happen next on any chart And Dylan has a style that makes complex TA easy to understand So you'll have the confidence to start setting up your own trades rather than just relying on calls from others Dylan also teaches some real gamechanging stuff on how to use leverage safely This is stuff I've not seen anywhere else It's not just about playing it safe It's uh yeah it's on another level I guarantee you'll come out feeling more knowledgeable and more confident Now you did hear me say earlier in the video that I was going to introduce you to something called the hot zone indicator Now this is something that I have been working on with the Chart Prime team and it's exclusive to the accelerator course So if you finish the accelerator course and you sign up with the various products there you are going to get exclusive access to the hot zone indicator that is constantly being developed by me and the developing team and we are really getting it to a point of absolute perfection at the moment So let's take a look at the hot zone indicator and let me tell you a little bit about it Yesterday in chart hackers I posted to the crowd are you feeling too bullish here's two headshot areas to watch for Now remember uh yesterday and the time you're watching this video that was on Wednesday uh earlier this week the market was green the market was pumping Now I used my basic TA to determine that these zones might be danger zones that these two areas could be uh rejection zones And how did I know that well I used a combination of the things that you're going to learn about in the accelerator course And you can see I've got a 382 fib there I've got that magic blue line that you're going to learn about as well and we've got horizontal levels And then you can see I've got an arrow at the bottom pointing to an oscillator And the the oscillator was getting tired Now you're also going to learn about this oscillator in the accelerator course Now imagine I could give you something that was a combination of a lot of these things coming together as one and then telling you uh you know that you might want to pay attention to certain areas So let's look and see how this all comes together using a hot zone indicator So here is the chart that I posted in chart hackers and you can see this rejection is now well underway So that tells us we were correct with our theory that we were going to get a move to the downside off that area Now let's test it out We've taken away a load of things here Let's take away some of our blocks as well And let's throw in the hot zone indicator Bang Okay look at that And you can see what's going on here Uh we've got a fire getting lit up for the hot zone indicator So when we have multiple points of confluence getting moved into the same place the hot zone indicator actually gives you a fire and it gives you an indication as to what it is getting tied in with So you can see we've even got a volume profile here on the right hand side It is also using information from the oscillators It's also using a little bit more uh a secret source there as well So giving you guys a little bit of a shortcut into these types of areas and just uh yeah just changing the game a little bit there uh for you guys So that is obviously exclusively available to the accelerator course So make sure you are doing the course and then you'll get those shortcuts guys And then don't forget I've got the most incredible community You can see behind me here chart hackers and that is also an offshoot of the accelerator course We've got the most incredible team in chart hackers And uh if you want to see a little bit more or have a sneak peek into chart hackers let me just give you a picture here This is my trading setups channel where we drop tons of DGEN or short-term setups Then you can see I do daily market updates I've also added a long-term crypto uh section here which gets updated every single Monday I do higher time frame chart updates for you guys And I've now added my stocks channel as well with Meta Tesla Microsoft Apple And we currently in a a meta long at the moment and looking for a dip down to 540 So all that information is available uh in chart hackers there for you guys And uh remember it's uh all about having a community to trade with Trading can be super lonely especially when things aren't going your way And uh we found that the hackers guys really stick together there and we really pull each other through especially when times are getting very difficult uh out there So guys I hope you enjoyed that very basic video on fibs Obviously we'll go into it in more detail on the accelerator course and I obviously talk about this stuff every single day on my trading show on Banter Plus which is Monday to Friday Catch that type of trading action live So I'm looking forward to seeing you guys Have a great day Catch you later [Applause] [Music]"
