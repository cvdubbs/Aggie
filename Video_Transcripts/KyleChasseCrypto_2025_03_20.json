    "transcript": " what if I told you the biggest Financial pivot in years just happened and it's right under everybody's nose and the mainstream media isn't even talking about it that's right while the talking heads are busy debating nonsense the Federal Reserve just made a move that changes everything the same fed that's been suffocating the economy for 2 years just signaled a reversal and if you understand history you already know what comes next liquidity is coming back baby but the real question is is it time to load up before the next big run or is this just another fake out before things go south stick with me because I'm breaking down exactly what's happening why it matters most importantly how you can profit let's go well yesterday ladies and gentlemen the thing the thing that we were all kind of waiting for the crypto nerds and mainstream alike even if you didn't know it it was Jerome pal at the fom meeting so the FED just dropped their biggest announcement and while most people saw a simple no rate change headline they missed the real story here's what the FED is actually doing they left rates unchanged for the second straight meeting they slashed their growth projections for 2025 raised their inflation expectations so much for that soft Landing that we've been hearing about and most importantly they're slowing down balance sheet runoff translation well they're starting to panic if you don't fully grasp why this is massive let me break it down for you because this is the Fed admitting in real time that their restrictive policies are over so what exactly was happening for the last 2 years the FED has been selling off US Treasury bonds and mortgage back Securities to reduce its balance sheet this process is called quantitative tightening it was designed to drain liquidity from the economy pushing rates higher and slowing down inflation think of it like this the Fed was forcing money out of the system by selling $60 billion worth of Treasury securities every single month that meant fewer dollars in circulation making borrowing more expensive and crushing risk assets like stocks and Bitcoin but now they're slamming the breakes starting in 2023 the Fed was selling $60 billion per month in treasuries aggressively shrinking liquidity in May 2024 that number dropped to 25 billion per month still restrictive but easing now just 5 billion per month at this rate quantitative tightening will be fully over by mid year and when that happens the liquidity floodgates open that's why markets are waking up because the second the FED stops pulling money out of the system it has to go somewhere so what is the fed's game plan and why do they have to cut interest rates soon why the sudden shift because the FED knows the economy is weaker than they're admitting they can talk about a soft Landing all they want but their own projections tell a different story lower GDP growth translation the economy is slower higher unemployment translation people are losing jobs inflation sticking around Translation your money keeps losing value here's a post from Caleb and remember it's not about if rate cuts are coming it's about how soon they'll be forced to pull the trigger and at this point the real question isn't just when they'll cut but whether it's already too late to stop a recession and back to the tariffs the tariffs the tariffs they're going to be the greatest thing that ever happened to this country the tariffs well Powell directly addressed the tariffs saying that it will cause short-term inflation and that it is transitory and just when you thought the FED couldn't get any more predictable we get this classic from Powell a reporter asks him if tariff induced inflation is transitory his response well that's the base case or that's the best case right so hold on we have heard that before oh yeah the last time they assured us that inflation was transitory we ended up with the wor worst inflation in 40 years so how well did that prediction age it ages like milk but here's where it gets even worse the fed's current economic forecasts already assume full tariff retaliation that means Powell and his team are baking in the worst case scenario expecting that if Trump's proposed tariffs go through remember April 2nd other countries will hit back just as hard yes that's what recip IAL tariffs mean now let's break this down if full tariff retaliation plays out we're looking at higher prices across the board because imported goods get more expensive companies passing those cost onto consumers meaning inflation sticks around longer it hit to global trade as countries push back with their own restrictions more pressure on the FED because if inflation stays High cutting rates becomes even riskier but what if Trump backs down from the most aggressive tariff well that changes the game entirely inflation could cool faster than expected allowing the FED to cut rates sooner markets could rally hard pricing in less uncertainty we know that markets hate uncertainty they love certainty right this is a big deal trade relations will stabilize reducing the risk of a full-blown economic slowdown so Powell's base case assumes an allout trade War but if that doesn't happen happen it means the fed's inflation fears could be overstated and you know what that means they might have to ease policy even faster bottom line Powell's transitory inflation story didn't hold up last time and so why should we believe good old Jerome this time let's talk about the dollar the good old green back the US dollar bill the worthless piece of junk that you carry out in your pockets well the weaker it gets the more markets love it while Powell fumbles his way through another press conference the US dollar Index or we call it the Dixie the dxy just hit a f Monon low cha ching now why does this matter because a weaker dollar means one thing liquidity starts flowing into risk assets see when the dollar weakens it means foreign investors can buy us assets cheaper because their local currency gets them more dollars global trade becomes more favorable for American companies since a weaker dollar makes us Goods more competitive I.E it's cheaper for people to buy us Goods markets get more room to run because a strong dollar can act like a tightening force on liquidity while a weaker dollar does the exact opposite and historically this is where the dominoes start to fall a weaker dollar tends to coincide with major rallies in stocks Commodities and Bitcoin now couple that with the fact that the FED is softening its stance on quantitative tightening a and suddenly we have a macro environment that's becoming very friendly to risk assets which brings us to let's talk about gold let's talk about gold baby let's talk about you and me let's talk about the good thing okay all right guys let's talk about gold gold broke alltime highs and it's just keeps going and this isn't some random anomaly gold moves when Global liquidity changes historically gold thrives when the dollar gets weak the FED eases monetary policy we're getting there uncertainty about inflation and economic policy increases does this sound familiar and here's where Bitcoin enters the conversation because the pattern has been consistent right check out this post I made here every time gold makes a major run Bitcoin follows 1 to 3 months later sound familiar also like Global M2 liquidity and why wouldn't it at this point Bitcoin is starting to treated like digital gold a hedge against inflation monetary debasement and a failing Fiat system so if history repeats itself Bitcoin could be the next asset to explode higher and with institutional adoption ramping up that might be happening sooner rather than later and if you're enjoying the content so far do me a favor it would mean a lot to me and everyone here that works on the Channel all the researchers and producers we would be really appreciative if you guys would like the video if you're new to the channel my name is Kyle I've been in this industry for 13 years and I try to bring you guys the most relevant information so you can make the best decisions on your crypto Playbook and of course a free way to help the channel would be to share these videos with your friends and loved ones as well okay now let's get back into it and as we talked about yesterday in the video institutions their money is ready and it's starting to come back into the space yeah like it or love it institutions are here and now we got to deal with them and this is where things get really interesting for years institutions have been hesitant to fully Embrace Bitcoin but now the floodgates are opening let's start with black rock their Global head of digital assets just said on record a recession would be huge Catalyst for Bitcoin check this out doesn't reflect that well unless if people have less money they have less money to buy Bitcoin right or there or if there's the wealth effect of people having less money in the market in stocks they have less money to buy Bitcoin that's part of it on a short-term basis but ultimately why I make that comment is Bitcoin is long liquidity in the system right it's catalyzed by more fiscal spending and debt and deficit accumulation that happens in a recession it's catalyzed by lower interest rates and monetary stimulus that tends to happen in recession and it's catalyzed to some extent over just fears of General uh social disorder right and that too unfortunately is something that can come up in a recession so the market has almost it seems got gotten this in some ways uh you know not particularly well calibrated but that's where the opportunity comes in for education in a market in an asset class it's still very nent right and so we've been doing a lot of that in terms of Education around our clients all right let's translate that for you guys the same institutions that once dismissed Bitcoin as a speculative asset are now positioning it as a key hedge against economic instability and they're not alone 80% of Institutions plan to increase their exposure in 2025 this isn't retail speculation anymore this is institutional Capital moving in and just look at what's happening to the ETF space we have Salon of Futures ETFs launching tomorrow we have the first ever Suite ETF has been filed xrp just got a major legal Victory solidifying its position in the crypto Market likely leading to an ETF coming and we are witnessing the institutionalization of crypto in real time like it or hate it this is what's happening and guess what for the first time ever a sitting US president is addressing a crypto conference think about that for a second just a few years ago crypto was the wild west and now it's being acknowledged as the at the highest levels of government if that's not a sign that the tides are shifting I don't know what is what does this mean for us for you for me for the retail for our friends and family the ones that we love the non- institutions let's connect the dots here so the FED is pivoting quantitative tightening is coming to an end the dollar it's weakening bullish for hard assets like Bitcoin gold is exploding Bitcoin historically follows institutions are lining up for crypto in 2025 Global M2 liquidity is skyrocketing which is a leading indicator for Bitcoin to follow just two or two and a half months later but here's the big question are we at that stage of the next major rally look macro Trends take time but the dominoes are falling back into place liquidity is coming back hard assets are surging and institutional adoption is hitting a new level it's no longer a question of if but when that doesn't mean there won't be volatility the FED could still fumble this tariffs could cause Market turbulence but historically these shakeouts are exactly what sets up the biggest moves higher guys if you want to make sure to capitalize on this opportunity make sure you watch this video on how the crypto markets have changed changed since the previous bull cycles all right guys and that's it for tonight stay informed stay sharp and I'll catch you on the next one see you"
