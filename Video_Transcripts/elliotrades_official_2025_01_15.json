    "transcript": " you have 30 days left until the most consequential Bull Run in the history of cryptocurrency explodes with new activity and exponential growth that is of course if crypto stays on track and completes its final year of its four-year cycle the way that it has in 2013 2017 in 2021 and what we expect to happen here in 2025 you see this is one of my most important videos I'll make all year and that is predicting the most important trends that happen during 2025 and Beyond and the timing of this is incredible CU Bitcoin dominance has just formed another lower high for the first time in 4 years and as this number falls down towards the bottom end of the range altcoins will start to go parabolic this is the season where the most gains in crypto are made historically the fourth year of the four-year cycle this is the playoffs the World Series if you're going to focus for any period of time on crypto it's this it is when all the action hits It's when all of the excitement hits and it's also one of the most risky times to be invested in crypto because after the fourth year of the cycle comes the bare Market which is when most people lose their shirts so this will be one of my most important videos I make over the entire cycle which is my predictions for 2025 or the final year of this fouryear cycle in crypto now if you're new to the channel my name is Elliot AKA elot trades I've been investing and making content on crypto here on YouTube for over 7 years I'm also a founder of multiple projects in the space which are collectively worth over over a billion dollars I know most of the founders in the space I consult with a lot of the teams in the space I'm deeply involved and invested in the future of this industry I also do my best to expose my own biases anytime I hold large positions have invested in round have consulted with a project I make that abundantly clear and those are publicized on my Twitter my goal is to create the best content the best community and of course the best products in the space with that said if you guys are excited smash that like button if you're new make sure to subscribe for more content like like this and let's get into my predictions for 2025 now the first major prediction that I have is we're about to see a major liquidity cycle and a macro Tailwind that has up to this point not really been supporting the crypto ecosystem as one of the best investors in the space Chris briski says now that the books have closed on 2024 let the flows of 2025 ride now if you're wondering how important these macro Tailwinds are for Bitcoin in crypto take a look at this in November of 2021 the Federal Reserve or the FED announced that it would begin to taper assets purchases also known as quantitative easing or QBE in response to high inflation now would it surprise you to learn that that was almost exactly to the Pico second the top of the prior Bull Run and that immediately following this announcement we saw the markets fall for upwards of 12 months almost to the day to November of 2022 the market went through a fullscale collapse there's a saying don't fight the fed and anyone who abided by that don't fight the FED logic completely crushed it by selling at the top in 20 21 and staying out of the market until the waters were safe now if you go to my YouTube channel which you're probably already at here but if you go to my videos you'll see that I was making bearish content all throughout 2022 and the beginning of 2023 but then right here I made this video new bull market you can see it here and I talked about the bailouts for the bank that the FED approved and this was the first bit of liquidity that they introduced since they started that rate cut cycle or that rate hiking cycle rather and it was this signal that made me get full bore back into the crypto space and start being fully long crypto and as you can see I was bullish ever since I literally just fullon went bull mode and I never switched my tune because I saw that the Line in the Sand had been drawn and that a liquidity barrier was being put up to defend against the collapse of banks to defend against effectively the current economic system and once I saw that signal from the FED even though they didn't overtly say that they were beginning quantitative easing they put a cap on the maximum amount of quantitative tightening that they would allow to impact the financial system and they effectively stealth printed trillions of dollars this to me was enough to get fully back in the ecosystem to get fully back into the markets now while it wasn't the perfect Pico picoo bottom here that was right here in March of 2023 and since then we've seen upside of what was this 428 in Bitcoin from the bottom to the top and that was simply based on looking at the signals from the Federal Reserve and not fighting the fed well for the most of this bull run the Fed has been saying they keeping things restrictive but they are finally loosening up we had our first rate Cuts just a few months ago and we are now looking forward to the point where they will begin direct stimulus of the market or quantitative easing and that still has not happened yet and if you haven't followed bacon he's a good buddy of mine you should definitely follow him he's been covering a lot of these macro factors very closely but in short we will start seeing the FED introduce more and more liquidity into the ecosystem now for more bullish macro factors you have to meet this guy Scott bessent he's Trump's pick for Secretary of the Treasury will decide and gets their own decisions over how to spend the treasury general account or the TGA which gets filled up in variety of ways this is effectively a way that the federal arm of the government can spend money and he will want to weaken the dollar Scott bessent also is a very strong supporter of crypto and he understands that as you weaken the dollar you drive money into the markets you drive money into stocks you drive money into real estate and everybody thrives businesses Thrive stocks Thrive individuals Thrive that's what creates wealth and that's what Scott bessent is going to do this is huge and this is massively beneficial to bitcoin something that we have not had present for this entire run but was definitely present last extreme crypto bull market you also have Global liquidity which fluctuates you can see this it oscillates down and up here you can see here that it actually bottomed right here at the end of 2022 and it set to top or continue to grow through the entirety of next year into the middle of 2026 now does that mean that the crypto Bull Run will last until the middle of 2026 we don't know in fact that's not my base case but you couple this with a new friendly SEC as we've seen Paul Atkins is the Trump nominee for the SEC so there will be regulatory Clarity which will'll talk a little bit about at the end of this video as well as massive macro liquidity being pushed into the crypto ecosystem that will be one of the single most important trends that will fuel the growth of the industry throughout 2025 we had macro headwinds turning into macro Tailwinds the winds now in our sales not working against us and while that's been a pretty obvious trend I'm going to seal this section with two major predictions the first prediction is that we will see a Bitcoin strategic reserve and that Bitcoin strategic Reserve might come with additional purchases of Bitcoin but it will definitely come with protections to not sell any more of the current seized Bitcoin that the US government holds they hold something like 200,000 Bitcoin currently now the second major prediction that I'm going to make is that QE will begin overtly in the second half of 2025 I believe it'll take some time for Trump to get fully set up we're already seeing a ton of conflict and battles between Trump and Congress in confirming his nominations for his cabinet I could see lots of Tom Foolery and games happening throughout the first quarter of the year and being a little bit of a rocky road for people to get fully into their positions set up and begin doing any significant work but lo and behold the second half of 2025 will be when a lot of big activity starts to really kick off the appointments will be fully confirmed Trump will have his team in order and they will have had a few weeks to a few months to start actually getting stuff done and they do not want to wait because if they wait too long they risk losing their major majorities at the midterms that's in the Senate and the house they risk losing their ability to push through bills so the first two years of this Administration will be extremely busy and I expect for there to be massive actions by the end of 2025 but probably not at the very beginning that is besides executive orders which he's going to do a lot of but those won't be as significant as the massive liquidity flows that will happen with the appointments of a new treasury secretary the appointments of a new SEC commissioner and the ability for lawmakers to actually enact and pass legislation that will be beneficial to the crypto industry so two predictions in the macro Tailwinds which is that Bitcoin strategic Reserve will be created and that the second half of 2025 is when we will see overt quantitative easing now I did want to point out because the bond market has been exploding upwards which is usually a sign that effectively people don't believe that there will be quantitative easing because if they keep cutting rates that should mean that these long-term borrowing rates continue to go down but they've gone up and that is actually not because of the lack of faith in the FED as much as I believe this which is that China and Japan have stopped buying 10-year t- Bells when there's not enough buyers for a certain debt vehicle like a treasury bill the interest rates creep up you can think of this as there being a sale on an asset that people don't want to buy except when it's debt people actually want a higher return on their money if they're not interested in something a higher return a higher percentage return is like a sale it's like saying okay we'll give you a little more if you buy this debt and so you can think of a higher rate on t- bills as effectively less demand and if China and Japan both stopped buying our US national debt we know that that's a whole different topic that could be why we're seeing higher interest rates not necessarily the market actually not believing that the FED will cut rates so keep that in mind people are using this particular chart the growth of the 10-year bond as a way to signal that maybe the FED won't actually stimulate markets next year I think they're wrong and furthermore if Trump actually does create a Bitcoin strategic Reserve I think the price targets for this particular Bull Run need to be changed they need to be elevated significantly and that is of course if Bitcoin is actually bought on Market by the US government that's a whole new ball game we could easily see prices of half a million to a million dollars Bitcoin in that scenario and finally we have here Eric Trump talking about the opportunity for there to be zero tax crypto trades here in the United States you can see here from this clip crypto to the United States Treasury a person who pledged to make crypto taxfree I mean think about all these incredible things there's talk of actually making crypto trades taxfree for certain American cryptos or us cryptos we don't know what that means yet CU most cryptos exist overseas but we can assume that if there are American teams that they would be eligible to have taxfree trading on their crypto that would be insane that would be the biggest economic Tailwind the biggest Sonic Boom of deregulation and macro Tailwind stimulus for crypto you've ever seen so sit tight because this could be an absolute doozy if this happens and that brings us into the second bucket of predictions which is regulatory clarity now we will see a significant dose of regulatory Clarity the kind that crypto folks have been begging for for what feels like forever tell us the rules tell us how to act tell us what we can do what we can't do help us comply and build stuff that institutional money can come and invest in without the question without the doubt is the government going to come in and try to squash this that's been the overhang for the last you know 12 or 13 years is the government just going to come in and try to step on this industry and depending on the administration like we saw with the last Administration they tried they failed but they tried and this new Administration is saying not only we going to not try to step on you but we're going to boost you up and we're going to give you clear rules of the road and those rules will do a few things my first prediction is that they will enable a fee switch on dii protocols you see this chart this is a this is the biggest D protocol or one of the biggest ones in the entire industry you could see it was pretty much down only from 2021 top and yes it recovered a little bit you could see it got up here to a 135 obviously the prior Peak was 629 right so it was still pretty low here at $130 right it was still 80 plus% down but then Trump wins the election and boom this thing starts skyrocketing up from 135 all the way up to 321 I think it peaked up and almost touched 400 bucks on a wick and that's because decentralized Finance borrowing lending banking like services within crypto are very much so in the Target zone of regulators with an unfriendly Administration but with a friendly Administration everyone knows that these are the products and services that make a ton of money and that if they had a fee switch flipped on the tokens that could ACR that value I mean you're essentially like owning a bank who wouldn't want to play casino owner who wouldn't want to play Bank owner everyone wants to do that and that's what defi allows you to do and if there's a fee switch enabled projects like a and other ones which we'll talk about here in a second could be the massive beneficiaries again I want to be clear these are just examples there are tons of defi fee switch projects but here are a few that will benefit and we think will benefit tremendously from this particular change the first project would be Donald Trump's World Liberty five you see this project was actually launched directly by Trump I think as a way to kind of fund raise during this crazy election we know that he had some massive legal bills that he was fighting and he was fundraising in every way he could but this is very much a real project and they have a whole team cooking up some defi applications here and the reason why I bring this up and this token isn't tradeable it won't be for quite some time the reason why I bring this up is that this project has actually entered into a partnership with several others and here you have them you see the world Liberty fi treasury actually bought a link and eth 1 million of a and Link and $10 million of eth obviously eth is more of a piggy bank coin but we can see here that there's also been a partnership with Athena Labs now Athena Labs is the number one stable coin in the ecosystem where you can earn a ton of money I don't want to go into too much about Athena but essentially I've talked about this before Athena is like a synthetic dollar it's an algo stable and has this fluctuating apy that you earn in what they call a delta neutral strategy effectively they're shorting Bitcoin on the exchanges while holding it and that allows them to have sort of zero risk if the price goes up or down they don't lose any value but there's interest paid to people shorting and to people holding shorts in a bull market so this is effectively a way that institutions generate yield at a big scale but it requires a ton of processes to be set up kind of stuff that you and I would never do I think something like Athena would be able to enact a fee switch for their Ena governance token and this might be a huge beneficiary of the fee switch change as you can see here can you guess where Donald Trump got elected here boom absolutely no question no doubt about it and they even got the official partnership nod sometimes being dead on the money and just going hey a Athena chain link they're obviously partnered with Donald Trump's literal crypto project why not belong those particular projects for the regulatory Clarity aspect of this but they're just simple examples other ones like blur if nfts get popular again or aerody Drome on base Jupiter wherever you see trading wherever you see fees being created maybe even pump. fund those types of projects if they drop a token we know wherever there is a ton of Revenue wherever there is a ton of fees the ability to now share that Revenue in those fees through a token that is the entire excitement of crypto is to be able to own things in a decentralized way and that's what's coming here with regulatory Clarity that I believe will happen in 2025 the next prediction within this regulatory Clarity bucket will be that major platforms may drop or may introduce their own cryptocurrencies or at least allow them to be tradable to be accessible and to flow through their ecosystems namely Twitter or X I do not think that it is a coincidence that X money has been announced here to go live the same year that Trump takes office otherwise we can assume that this would have been absolutely attacked by every single federal or government agency known Dem man every three-letter agency known demand would have gone after Twitter's X money because we know that they want to have crypto in it we know that they're facilitating what could be one of the biggest Financial networks that is designed really as an attack on traditional Banking and I believe that this will be a massive Tailwind for crypto users we all know that crypto really lives on Twitter lives on X as well as YouTube and being able to see crypto flow through X would be a massive tail and I think that major companies major networks major websites will begin to look at potentially having coins flow through their websites in a way that we have only really dreamed of before and next I believe we will see a crypto stock Giga bubble Mega boom I think that the things listed publicly tradable on Wall Street on NASDAQ wherever they are listed most likely NASDAQ those are going to be prime targets for some of the biggest money bags in the world I would not be surprised to see crypto stocks now that they are completely in the clear completely free from any regulatory overhead get insane inflows of capital with regulatory Clarity that is going to be a major Target A major benefit officiary here things like coinbase things like micro strategy I do believe that 2025 will be extremely profitable for coinbase but this whole world of packaging up crypto companies and crypto products for the stock market has only just begun and you will see a whole lot more of that in 2025 so macro Tailwinds come with a ton of benefits regulatory Clarity comes with an insane amount of growth and it will have huge implications on specific tokens within the ecosystem namely defi but now let's talk about another Trend that is set to Define 2025 on a scale I think people aren't yet ready for yep it's AI we've been talking about AI since mid 2023 now if you recall we put out a video in Q3 of 2023 where I said my entire portfolio will be based around three narratives memes Ai and gaming those three have been my buckets and as you know 2024 was the year of memes 2025 is already setting up to be the most insane year for AI we've ever seen I agree here with tyi that we're really only here're about to see the massive explosive growth and this will be kind of like the stock market bubble that we saw in the late '90s where AI will reach the peak of inflated expectations much like we've seen with other Technologies in the past we will see that with AI this cycle and AI Builders who are building anything cool in the normal world will all flood into cryptocurrency you see over the last few weeks people who are building anything in AI saw anyone building chat Bots ai influencers ai agents whatever you're building it is getting a way more significant premium valuation here in cryptoland these teams that may not have been able to raise their own seed rounds not may have not been able to finance their projects properly are getting massive amounts of capital by launching something here in crypto the brain drain from non- crypto aai to crypto AI will be significant and we will see the most consequential AI projects AI companies launched here in cryptoland in 2025 it's only over the last few months that we've seen real smart people leave Ai and jump into crypto because they realize that this is is where they need to be forming their organizations this is where the capital formation is the best and where it's the freest and where it can make its way to the smartest builders in the world that's why AI is only at the beginning of its Omega cycle and I believe that 2025 will be a year that if you don't learn to actually use AI research AI invest in AI you will be in a world of pain and this is of course due to the explosion of AI agents now if you want a primer on AI check it out about two weeks ago I put out an AI video you can see it here a lot of those coins have exploded gone absolutely nuts AI xbt ai1 16z uh virtuals whatever it is there're pretty much all zerro they've all gone absolutely nuts vertical AI there's been so many AI projects that have exploded over the last few weeks since I made that video but it's important you understand the dramatic shift that has happened in this industry since the AI agent craze took hold I mean AI agents have renewed the excitement I'm not going to go much further 2025 will be the year of AI and I believe that AI that improves user experience meaning I can go and have a natural conversation with an and say hey I want to buy this token hey I want a dollar cost average hey I want to see a snapshot of my portfolio hey I want to send some coins to my friends something where you can just chat with the chat bot and it handles all the crypto for you that my friends is going to take crypto from this nerdy play thing that only super technical people can understand and make it a true Mass adoption Network this is the bridge that we've been looking for it's AI agents right now ai agents are being B on they're being speculated on just more in the meme category they'll have content creators they have all these different categories LaunchPad ad kind of like pump fund but for AI to me the real magic is in fixing ux and once they do that crypto will flow through the internet in a way that we've only dreamed of before 2025 is the year I believe AI agents will start to fix the ux problem in crypto one project doing this or at least focused on doing this they're not live yet is wayfinder foundation this was created by Echelon Prime which is a coin that we've been talking about since $2 sitting about 14 bucks we covered it again recently and you actually get your AI wayfinder tokens just by staking Prime so it's a cool like bundle a Ai and gaming project uh obviously Prime is a gaming project and again virtuals is the biggest sort of AI agents Launchpad we talked about several AI agents both on my 2025 top coins video as well as the AI top coins video I did a few weeks ago make sure to check those both out I should have said this at the beginning but if you have not seen my intro videos my beginner's guide my 96% will lose my exit strategy video all those videos those are required viewing if you actually want to win in crypto and not just get wrecked most people lose money in crypto so I have a ton of primer content for people newer to the industry make sure that you are not one of those statistics so please watch that do yourself a favor save yourself some pain and Agony learn from my mistakes and hopefully you do not become yet another statistic another Loser on their first cycle because most people have to wait a few years if not several years before they truly make it here in crypto now finally another big Trend here besides AI agents that I believe I'm betting on is going to be bit tensor subnets now bit tensor tow is the biggest AI project but it's very hard to get in and use these projects to trade them in the way that a lot of crypto native people are used to there is a project I talked about my top coins for 2025 video called tobot and that is looking to fix it to effectively make that whole ecosystem tradable interactable uh bridging all the different things that will allow for all those AI project ecosystem projects to become part of sort of mainstream crypto if that makes sense now let's move on to a product category you know that I am extremely passionate about which is of course gaming now gaming has been a lagard for the most part obviously if if you're involved in superverse my project that I co-founded and this community is heavily involved with it has obviously dramatically outperformed the rest of gaming it's been by far the best project in that space But it's also been a significant outlier most of the projects in gaming have failed to live up to the hype and I believe that is going to change and it's going to take place in Three core ways first of all we have gonzilla off the grid as you know we've been talking a lot about this this has been the first triaa Masterpiece game that we've seen hit the crypto ecosystem it is absolutely the best quality game that we've seen here and they have incredible lure incredible gameplay all the streamers like this game and we'll see the first real AAA attempts at success here first with Off the Grid but there will be others we will see the first real AAA immersive gameplay crypto games that we've ever seen in 2025 actually go for mainstream launches Off the Grid has just been in Early Access and they still have their main launch ahead of them now the next will be in telegram so you have AAA and then you have fully casual gaming in Telegram and this is because Telegram has almost a billion active users now what I like about telegram is this is a real Network this is a real product I use telegram all the time it's my favorite chat app most people in crypto absolutely adore telegram this is not just a bull run phenomenon the telegram blockchain May pump it may rise and fall with crypto's bull markets but people are on telegram 24/7 and people play video games 24/7 telegram is proving to be the next big explosive hub for casual gaming people are comparing it to the early Facebook gaming days and I believe that telegram gaming will be one of the most explosive parts of the 2025 Bull Run so you have AAA gaming and you also have telegram gaming but this is the one prediction and possibly my most controversial prediction that I will make here on the channel especially as it pertains to gaming in 2025 now what you see behind me is 666 the Number of the Beast no I'm just kidding this is the axi infinity chart and we actually talked about this project under a dollar around 50 back in 2020 the end of 2020 on my predictions video for 2021 it was actually one of my most important prediction videos I ever made and in that prediction video I predicted that gaming would actually be a massive Trend and I used axi Infinity as an example and it went on to do it went on to hit 160 bucks I think it's the high yeah the high was $165 here and this was from 50 so over 300X from when I pointed out this project in 2020 but it's come all the way down to $66.66 which is over 95% loss it's one it's a crushing loss now a lot of people used the collapse of axi infinity as proof proof that play to earn meaning you play a game and you earn crypto by playing it is not a sustainable model that is destined to collapse and while that might be true it might have been true with axi Infiniti my belief is that a bull market will always favor extreme and exciting tokenomics based projects that pay yield and those projects especially playto earn projects will absolutely explode during able market now will they sustain and continue to pay out and continue to grow during a beer market I don't know play to earn has yet to show a sustainable model but I believe that play to earn 2.0 with many Lessons Learned and most importantly far better gameplay than 2021 is coming in 2025 I believe that we will see play to earn 2.0 Mania in a way that many people do not expect to happen and the blockchain that I wouldn't be surprised to take full advantage of this is ronin and that is because they are the ones who created axi infinity and they have not just one but several other games that have actually iterated on the play to earn model and are in Prime position to when asset prices start ballooning really take advantage of the playto earn flywheel but let's be honest these playto earn games can happen on any chain on eth on layer 2os on immutable on beam on salana wherever there is a great tokenomics model and a game that's able to get itself out there to a big enough community that flywheel will go absolutely insane so one of my biggest predictions and probably my most controversial and interesting prediction from 2025 gaming space is that play to earn 2.0 will be much bigger than play to earn 1.0 and that was pretty big and in a play to earn Mania in a gaming Mania I expect for nfts to get an entirely new wave of excitement specifically gaming nfts which I believe are the highest form of nft and we'll see here things like imposters and neotokyo two products I've helped co-found these are certainly not the only ones but I'd be on the lookout for gaming nfts when we hit 2025 because I believe they will come into Vogue and are probably dramatically mispriced nfts are also historically very IL liquid assets that once the attention and excitement comes the prices can move dramatically and that's an area that almost no one is paying attention to right now complete Ghost Town Complete blue ocean if this hits and gaming nfts do take off the upside there will be tremendous Now quickly I will say I also think mem coins will not drive the bull market as much as they did in 2024 I think that their over performance there will still be massive performers I think the king of memes the big memes that have huge communities there will be some crazy ones that take take off and go viral but it won't just be a meme driven Market not like it was in 23 and 24 I believe that that was a function mostly of the bare market and lack of belief in the tech and now that we're seeing explosions of interest in AI Tech in AI agents in l1s in different types of networks I believe the attention will shift once again to protocols and Technology like it has every Bull Run in the past and so mem coins will not overperform in 20125 is another prediction here and now for my final prediction which is that if we are to get a Bitcoin strategic result Reserve I believe we might see something like this we may see the biggest bubble we've ever seen in crypto one that Rivals the NASDAQ bubble of the late 990s this is A7 trillion do market cap in the late '90s and I believe we might see a chested for inflation 7 to 10 trillion dollars in market cap in crypto almost exactly mirroring the dotom bubble of the late 90s but it's important to realize that if this happens and we do reach 10 trillion in market cap and we do see massive astronomical price targets for Bitcoin such as $400,000 or $500,000 per coin achieved in Bitcoin I believe that it's inevitable that people will start saying there's not going to be a bar market and that my friends is the oneway ticket to a crushing bear and so I believe we might see the biggest Bull Run of all time but I also believe it will be followed by a bare market and people will believe at the end of that bull market that it's not possible but I'm here to tell you that that is not my prediction my prediction is that in 2025 we will see the beginnings maybe it won't crack until the beginning of 201 26 maybe it'll happen earlier at the end of Q2 2025 but at some point we will see the bull market end and we will see a crippling bare market so it's important that throughout this bull market you take profits aggressively I know I'm going to be taking profits as I've explained explicitly and excruciatingly in all of my exit strategy videos I will be taking profits throughout 2025 that is what I'm going to do but I also believe that the future looks like this which is if you look at the NASDAQ chart zoomed out what you'll see is that the market fell from from the late '90s all the way down to about 2002 uh August of 2002 and from August of 2002 you've had almost uninterrupted almost uninterrupted bull market that lasted for literally 22 years we've seen what is this 37x in the entire Market since 2002 and I believe that that is the kind of growth that we'll see at the tail end of the bare Market that we are going to go through so to be clear I believe the bull market will end in 2025 I believe we'll see another horrible crypto be Market but I believe that what comes next is not just years but Decades of bullishness as crypto becomes the industry of the future the new Financial system the open and Democratic world the great equalizer that pushes power to the edges specifically it pushes power to the people who believe in it so I implore you take this seriously understand that 2025 is most likely going to be the easiest time to transform your personal wealth and your future based on crypto assets that we have seen in our lifetimes as it will be the biggest and probably most explosive Bull Run that we've seen in our lifetimes and my goal is to make as much money as I can in 2025 take as much off the table by the time early to mid 2026 rolls around and make sure that I'm in Prime position to be buying the blood and accumulating as much Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as I can before what I think of as a multi- deade forever bull market that will commence in just a few years from now I sincerely hope this video has helped you I hope my 2025 predictions are of value to you if they have been make sure to destroy that like button and I highly encourage you to watch this video popping up which gives you a full breakdown of my AI pick a huge part of today's video but this gives you even more color on how I see the AI space and you should watch it right now see you soon [Music]"
