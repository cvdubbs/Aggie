    "transcript": " this is absolutely insane Donald Trump just officially launched a memec coin which has already become one of the top crypto currencies by fully diluted valuation in the space we saw this overnight in the US actually whilst I was asleep in Dubai and whilst a lot of people in Europe were asleep maybe you're just waking up and and you're seeing this take place uh where he tweeted on Truth social and on Twitter that his new official meme is here and I think a lot of people made a lot of money on this because it launched super low at like 50 cents then it started running up aggressively when I woke up in the morning it was around 6 bill and it's already gone to 18 billion fdv so this is absolutely insane like try and wrap your head around this the president elect of the United States has launched their only official meme coin like who would have thought even days ago yet years ago that we'd see the president of the US launching their own meme coin like this is a paradigm shift for crypto we had the SEC for four years coming after crypto calling things Securities going after crypto companies in the US and now we have the literal president of the US launching their own meme so we have a lot to discuss today because there are a lot of second and third order effects from this what does this mean for other cryptos what does this mean for Bitcoin what does this mean for onchain alss because we are seeing a sell-off across a lot of onchain alt specifically on salana because there's a lot of people rotating right now selling their positions in order to fund purchases of this coin kind of like the Pepe run that we initially saw it kind of acts like a a black hole and it sucks up liquidity so we need to talk about that and what it could mean for your altcoin positions Beyond this coin I also want to talk about the claims that this coin is fake real look into actually what happened because there's still a lot of people that don't believe this coin's real I think the signs that that we currently have at the time of recording this video is that it is real of course you could be watching this a day later and Trump may have come out and validated it or disapproved of it but um nonetheless the market is viewing this coin as real right now and I think the signs point to balance of probabilities this being a real coin so let's break down all of this today it's pretty crazy I wasn't planning on uploading today but uh Judy calls here because I've had to do a lot of managing of my portfolio we'll get into that later in the video and also I've started to make some mov in terms of coins that I'm dcing into I think there's a bit of opportunity at the moment and I'll also tell you what I'm doing with the Trump coin itself so to recap the coin launched overnight it's gone parabolic it's already hit a 16 Bill fully diluted valuation the market cap is only 3.3 billion that's because 80% of the supply is actually owned by Trump so they've centralized the majority of the supply so the real market cap is actually a lot less than what the fully diluted Market market cap is if you look at bubble Maps here you you can see that it is verified that 80% is basically being kept interestingly in an unlocked wallet which is not really standard practice in the space but there 80% of an unlocked wallet which is basically matching the distribution outline that's been posted on the official website whereby you can see the coins are being distributed into this uh distribution which is kind of a weird one that there are some definitely weird decisions here you know why are they keeping so much of the supply is that to manipulate price higher um what are the plans for those coins is it going to be air dropped obviously you wouldn't expect Trump to dump these coins but um we just don't know exactly what the plans are there hasn't been really much spoken about this coin apart from the fact that it's the official Trump meme a lot of people were in the early stages calling this fake and that makes complete sense like the initial reaction is oh this can't be real Trump must have been hacked right but as of the time of recording this video it's been 6 hours there's been no followup and you'd think that he would have already come out and made a public announcement that it was fake if it was fake the other thing that kind of alludes to the fact that it probably is real is the fact that the source code behind the website and the way that the website was constructed in terms of domain registration is very similar to the old site that Trump used for his nfts so it's likely the the same team behind this coin that did the Trump nfts but obviously you have to implement a little bit of caution on the non-zero chance that it is a fake but as I said the uh the latest info that we're seeing is that it's real and a lot of people are starting to realize this and bid this coin up aggressively it keeps going up and up and up and up so I guess I'll kind of give my opinion now on the token itself there's definitely a bull case here for the token going higher let me get that out of the way I mean if you look at the actual market cap sitting at around 3 and a half bill at the time of recording this video might be higher by the time you're watching and if you actually think about what's happened the president of the United States launching a meme I mean if you look at Doge's market cap what's Doge sitting out right now is it what 50 billion see 58 billion If This Were to become the biggest meme in crypto there still is upside in terms of market cap right so this still could 5 to 10x however the responsible miles is sitting here and saying look it's already run up a lot I don't really feel like chasing the pump here now I did play a little bit in this coin when I first woke up at 7 to8 Bill obviously that's already up nicely it might continue to go higher my Mantra is to buy dips and sell pumps that's something that I've been speaking about a lot on the channel for a long long time so for me to come out and say oh this is a great buy after it's already ripped and done huge multiples that's difficult for me but at the same time there definitely is a bull case to be put put together that this could become one of the biggest memes in crypto but to be honest I'm not really playing this coin with size I definitely will be actively trading it on hyper liquid but I'm not really playing the spot positioning here with size I'm mostly looking at the second and third order effects of what this means for crypto and using that to trade so I've got some opinions on what this means for AI coins onchain coins meme coins salana ethereum which I'll get into in a minute where I think I have more of an Edge playing that game than buying this coin after a huge run up that might be me right curving it might be as simple as this just shoots up into the top five and becomes one of the biggest coins but that's just my opinion on it anyway and you probably clicked on this video for my opinion uh nonetheless obviously anyone that managed to catch it on time has made a lot of money and if you were one of them I don't mind the idea of keeping a moon bag there and just seeing what happens with it so let's get into the second and third order effects because I think it does have some major effects on crypto the first first one is very bullish I don't think people are fully grasping what this means for crypto this is a full endorsement of cryptocurrency and it's a real pledge and a show of faith in the industry in general that Trump is actually potentially going to back up what he's been saying you know the Bitcoin strategic reserve the us altcoins all this discussion around what he's going to do for crypto I tend to think that the likelihood of that is now higher that he is is coming out and really embracing this by launching his own coin it's also a bit of an Fu to gendler who has tried to refute meme coins and call a bunch of project Securities he's coming out and saying kind of f you here's a meme coin I'm going to launch it who knows what other projects he's going to launch so he's really embracing crypto which I think fundamentally for the next four years during his presidential term is is a very bullish thing for crypto and I think once the market realizes this it'll realize just how bullish this is for the space in General the other thing it's doing is it's it's like a mass on boarding I think like if this coin actually gained traction and it's obviously tomorrow going to get a lot of media attention there's going to be a lot of noise about it because it's we've never seen this before it's going to get a lot of eyes back on crypto currency so from a fundamental perspective I tend to think it's a bullish thing now there is the counterargument that does it maybe slightly impede the legitimacy of what Trump is trying to do with cryptocurrency if you have the Senate and especially the Democrats likely to point out this meme as maybe a flaw in Trump's strategy so is the fact that he launched this meme potentially endangering some of the other legitimate stuff he's trying to do there is that counterargument but overall I think the market should respond to this as a positive thing longer term right in the shorter term there definitely is bearish arguments and and bullish arguments so for salana there is a massive bullish argument because he chose to launch this meme on salana so once again it kind of solidifies salana space as the leading blockchain for all experimentation for meme coins obviously salana is responding very very positively in the wake of this and for good reason also if he launched on salana does it mean that we could potentially see a salana ETF that could potentially be a bullish Tailwind for soul and that's why you're seeing the price actually increase as Alo says here everything continues to happen on salana this cycle valuation Gap simply has to continue closing with eth crime is legal season many more people will now feel like they can launch coins good actors or Bad actors they will launch coins on Soul crazy froy q1 seems inevitable mcoin super cycle guys sounding prophetic now and those Majors surely going to benefit here I think everyone has underestimated how far Trump is going to take this and how many announcements are coming this is obviously where the bullish argument for crypto comes from us strategic Reserve seems entirely plausible now he really is the crypto president Trump launched nfts last cycle so natural progression is a meme coin but it carries more weight as he is actually the president of the United States this time it's definitely the bat signal for degeneracy to fully take off not quite a top signal as it's not really out of character but this is the kind of thing that can lead to many Al blowoff tops in the next couple of months I do think it has slightly accelerated the cycle I think when frequency of crazy events volatility sentiment swings gets more and more and more intense like we've seen over the last week people going from depression to Euphoria to Trump launching a meme all sorts of stuff happening crazy swings it's an indicator that we're we're late stage like eighth or ninth inning or approaching it so I think you do have to have your guard up a little bit and be on high alert because even though the most money is made in late stage we're certainly not early anymore to the market in general and that's just being reflected in the price action it's a difficult time to be a holder it's probably more of a Traders environment because we're seeing so many swings and it's really hard to hold through times of turbulence now obviously if you can in the top all coins there's a lot of money to be made because especially if this acts as a tailin for crypto there are a lot of coins in the market especially the ones from the strong narratives like AI that I think are eventually going to do really really well it's just going to be a difficult period and one where you're going to have to manage lot of emotions due to the volatility you know like what if Trump comes in announces some stuff we see you sell the news event you're going to have to go through that volatility then we see another crazy parabolic run you're going to have to go through that volatility so just keep that in mind try and be levelheaded we're not in the early early stages of a bull market anymore you definitely need to have your guard up and you need to trade a little bit differently than how you are maybe trading over the last few months you need to keep more Stables not be all in Risk all the time time and uh just make sure that you're taking profits when we do get crazy pumps cuz that is the stage of the cycle now obviously it's bullish for salana it's probably bullish long-term for crypto right and it might even be bullish mid to longterm for memecoins but in the short term it has been a little bit bearish for onchain alts specifically altcoins on salana because it's acting like a liquidity black hole what does this mean a lot of people are chasing the gains right now so they're selling a lot of onchain stuff that's why we've seen AI take a hit that's why we've seen a lot of onchain memes take a hit because they're trying to chase the pump so sell that stuff and buy back into this Trump coin and because of that we've seen a selloff across a lot of onchain old coins we'll discuss the AI coins in a couple of minutes here a lot of them got smacked this morning because there's a lot of drisking happening as people a chase the Trump pump but B drisk and anticipation of others chasing the Trump pump and this may not go away for at least 24 to 48 hours because if the Trump bubble gets bigger which it could in the morning when more people wake up and see this there could be a continued selling effect now I view this as actually being a great buying opportunity for some of these coins which we'll discuss in a minute but you do have to be aware that short term it's probably a little bit bearish for onchain stuff so if you look at your portfolio today and you're wondering why some of your onchain bags are down this is the reason it's a it's kind of a Black Swan event it's no one expected this to happen it's a look liquidity sync as people kind of trade in and out and eventually what happens is liquidity rotates the other way so if this keeps going higher and then you see the cool down liquidity eventually rotates into other coins and that's where you'll see Memes on Soul AI on Soul Etc doing really well but the the same thing happened on Pepe last year and in 2023 when it started running a lot of memes actually Consolidated into Pepe and then when Pepe hit its top it dispersed back into other coins so just be wary of how that rotation is happening right now the The onchain Trenches are super PVP right now so either you're trading onchain or you're in long-term onchain positions and this is a great opportunity to add like if there are AI coins that you miss the runup this is a great opportunity to add some of them if you have a longer term outlook on that I'll discuss the exact ones that I'm looking at in a minute here some other points that Fus points out good chance this changes the pace of the cycle as I discussed I think it really accelerates things so just be on the lookout for that and things could get crazy soon short-term bearish on majority of vaults As Trump sucks liquidity which we just discussed incredibly bearish on trump/ Mago coins that that's an obvious one because now this is the legitimate one bearish for eth bullish for soul I agree eth BTC actually just made a new low because this is launched on soul and Soul's where all the attention is right now probably bearish for most other memes I agree in the short term with Fus but in the longer term when we see that rotation back into other memes this could actually legitimize that as a play uh lucky points out some of his trades at the moment long fart coin plus Trump long Soul short xrp flat slsh BTC short-term Spot Long some AI onchain plays this is something I'm doing actually taking advantage of the dip on some of the onchain plays probably trades the market is missing currently I agree I mean this is like a new paradigm for crypto like this has really shaking up the market the dynamic of the onchain trenches the dynamic of retail it's like a full Market reset so just be aware that things might be a little bit weird over the next couple of weeks very volatile very choppy difficult to navigate I suggest having a a really good pulse at the moment of what your long-term plays are I discussed some of mine in the last video I've got some plays that uh I'm very secure in longer term and I also have a willingness to adapt with some of the unchain stuff as well so you kind of have to have extra conviction in your longer term plays if they're down double down on them and be hyper Vigilant with your short-term plays because this Market is likely to be volatile now in terms of Bitcoin from a price action perspective it actually looks good what I don't want to see is us starting to break down this previous high at 10 12,500 I'd love to consolidate here that would be a great thing for Bitcoin but if we tuck back in here then I think we're probably going to pull back down into the range so just keep your eye on bitcoin on The Daily and the 4 hourly to make sure it can stay above this level now let me talk about meme coins and then I'll get into AI on the mem coin front a lot of memes are down in the last 24 hours cuz there is a big rotation into the trumpcoin so a lot of the onch onchain stuff is actually down I think if there are any High conviction memes that you have this could be a good DCA opportunity because as I mentioned before eventually I think there's a rotation back into some of them however I would be not in a rush right now to accumulate memes because that will only happen once Trump puts in a top and right now it's still going parabolic fart coins being the strongest performer this had a huge Spike but even things like Doge and other plays have started to retrace a little bit in the face of this pump I think mid to long term it could actually be bullish for memes but short term it's a little bit bearish for pretty much anything on chain especially on salana now for the AI coins it's also been bearish in the past 24 hours you've had huge draw Downs however I actually think this is an opportunity if you have been bullish AI or you actually missed the AI run over the last fews weeks this is a great opportunity for you to now consider starting to scale into some of the leading AI coins you can see a lot of them are down AI 16z AIX BT neur pretty much all of them are down and as game of 1 point out here when a liquidity vacuum of this scale occurs many rush to sell their Holdings out of fomo most of these sales are irrational so a lot of people selling coins to fund buying Trump right it's this knee-jerk reaction this creates great opportunities for both AI coins and some memes time to start shopping so this is a list of coins that I highlighted in my last AI video if there are any of these coins that after watching that video and I highly recommend you watch it that you found interesting or you're bullish on now's the chance for you to actually DCA into them at uh better prices and a lot of them are actually pulling down to high time frame support so you've got a6z pulling down to high time frame support AI xbt it's on the bottom of the money noodle now just keep your eye on what happens there there's also this key support level which it's flirting with at the moment obviously you kind of have invalid if you were dcing here but keep in mind it could break lower so that's also one to watch that's been one of the top AI coins fa is a coin that Jordi is quite uh bullish on my interview with him I had to delay a little bit because obviously this news broke but later you'll see why and this is one that I would consider dcing into Aon as well this is the leading def AI play and this had a massive blowoff I first talked about it at $12 on the channel went to 25 now it's pulling back to 15 I think as a DCA as a leading D AI play this one is actually quite a nice uh DCA over the coming days and then there coins LMT which have been some of my best trades over the past few months I called this one at 60 ran up to um sorry I called it at yeah 60 million market cap run up to 250 mil market cap so almost a 4ex and obviously it's an AI play on Soul there's big sell-offs happening on all the soul AI pairs you can actually look to maybe DCA into this support here if you did miss that play cuz it's come down from 26 now to 14 so I think it's creating opportunity across the board but just keep in mind this may not happen quickly this liquidity black hole happens as long as Trump keeps pumping and if it pumps for 3 Days onchain stuff could bleed for three days so any DCA you have make sure you do have inval if you want to play it as more of a trade or just be willing and size correctly so you can actually DCA over a matter of days and don't just like you know AE your full clip in now because that's where you can end up getting wrecked so I think it's a good opportunity for the onchain stuff some memes but mostly the AI stuff is I think that uh is primed to come back quite quickly I even saw this morning some of the rwa stuff pull back a bit if we get bigger pullbacks on stuff like checks that would be a great great buying opportunity and one that I look to add um I'm very bullish on q1 for rwa Check and C pulling my two picks discussed them yesterday but I think if you if you get bigger pullbacks on any of these they're good DCA for the next quarter in my opinion slightly longer term uh and yeah that that's pretty much my summary on this it's all a bit crazy I think it's bullish for crypto in general having the US president launching a meme I think it sets a precedent but shortterm it's bearish for unchain stuff which which I think for the top stuff if you still have conviction in it it's a good opportunity like AI for me is not going anywhere what is it a 14 or a $15 billion sector memes at their Peak last year were 45 bill I personally think AI is going to be a lot bigger than the mem coin run eventually even salax from 2021 was at what 130 bill this is still at 15 Bill almost a 10x from that so I think there's so much upside the only thing I will say with AI and I mentioned this in the last video is a lot of the stuff that's doing well in the shorter term won't maybe be around for the whole cycle so you have to be a bit more adaptive and willing to find new plays because there's so much stuff launching and the serious teams are going to do huge multiples but there'll be some that kind of fade off into irrelevance so you do have to have I think more of a trading mindset with a lot of them and in terms of the Trump coin itself look if you want to take a risk you can play it I'm personally not it's just not really part of my strategy I didn't really allocate or provision for this and I don't really want to dump my onchain bags to rotate into Trump so I'm not doing it but I could definitely see it going up more like especially if tomorrow it gets a lot of media attention the Trump family doubles down on it anyone that was saying it was fake and there's a lot of people out there 45% of mm crypto audience thinks it's fake the more that people start to think it's real the more people that wake up and and actually see what's happened the more people that will foer which is why I don't think this hype train is fully done yet but um I don't have enough conviction at the current prices to actually play this as a trade myself 3.7 Bill though is in a crazy market cap for the uh leading meme coin issued by the US president so do with that information what you will but uh yeah that's what I'm personally doing and these videos are a reflection of my bias and what I'm doing and what and what I'm looking at so overall going to be a c few weeks for crypto now uh definitely stay up to date with the channel turn notifications on CU I'll keep you updated with all of this stuff I've got an uh podcast with Jordi dropping pre this Trump launch but still has a lot of valuable info on the AI sector what we think about the market over the next few weeks and months and I think that'll be a valuable followup for you guys so just wanted to give you a quick update today and I'll see you on the next video peace out"
