    "transcript": " today. If you're in the Miles High Club Discord, we'll be trading them all throughout the week. We're very active with the setups, especially Paradise, who's been trading a lot of these on the lower time frames. He's going to keep you updated with a lot of these trades uh as the week progresses. So, we'll see you in there if you are in the Discord. Um but even if you're not, you can mark out these levels just based on classic support, resistance, uh get a trending indicator. If you don't have access to the MO money noodle, you can use, let's say, the 100 or 200 MA. does a similar job. Maybe not as refined to our strategy, but we'll do a similar job in giving you an idea for momentum."
